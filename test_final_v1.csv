A major feature is the calypso competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political exposés or rousing exhortations to ""wuk dah waistline"" and ""roll dat bumper"". The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of Bajan cooking during the Bridgetown Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the ""Pic-o-de-Crop"" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is Kadooment Day celebrated with a national holiday when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks.

"What person is Neil Broderick writing a book about?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A man unveils a valuable painting he picked up for $50,000 and is killed. A card with a large black ace (of spades) is put on his chest. Another ""Black Ace"" victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: ""At seven tomorrow night"", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace. Clancy starts reading it aloud and unsurprisingly the lights go off and the letter has vanished when the lights are turned on again. People locked in their rooms that night and Neil has a hidden car outside signal to him.

"Asiana Airlines said Wednesday it no longer plans to sue a San Francisco TV station over the use of racially offensive names. 
  
 The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6. It will no longer sue, as it had said it would do. 
  
 Asiana says it wants to focus on supporting passengers and families. The crash killed three and injured dozens. 
  
 Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names _ apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words _ on air and then apologized after a break. 
  
 Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians. ||||| Two passengers aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed while landing in San Francisco have sued the carrier, claiming they suffered ""extreme and catastrophic injuries and emotional distress"" as a result of the accident. 
  
 The suit is believed to be the first following the July 6 crash. A lawyer for Asiana didn't respond to a request for comment. 
  
 Asiana flight 214 hit a sea wall in front of a runway at San Francisco International Airport and skidded to a stop before catching fire. Three passengers died and dozens more were injured. 
  
 In their initial probe, National Transportation Safety Board investigators didn't find evidence of equipment malfunctions, agency Chairman Deborah Hersman said last week. The agency was looking into whether the pilots had received adequate training, according to people familiar with the investigation. 
  
 Asiana officials have repeatedly said the pilots were both highly experienced and the airline's training programs meet all international and South Korean requirements. 
  
 The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court by Younga Jun Machorro and her son, Benjamin Hyo-Ik Machorro. Also joining the suit was Hector Machorro, the husband of Younga and father of Benjamin, who wasn't aboard the flight. He claims losses stemming from his wife's injuries. 
  
 ""The conduct of Asiana's flight crew was egregiously reckless and negligent,"" said Michael Verna of Bowles & Verna LLP, the Walnut Creek, Calif., lawyers for the plaintiffs. ""These pilots were unable to do the most basic task—land on a runway in the middle of a clear day with no wind."" 
  
 Mr. Verna said that both Ms. Machorro and her son were treated at San Francisco General Hospital after the crash. X-rays revealed no broken bones, said Mr. Verna, but both suffered injuries to their backs and were still undergoing treatment. 
  
 Under an international treaty, Asiana, of South Korea, is liable for up to $150,000 in damages per injured passenger—damages that likely would be paid by the airline's insurers, legal experts said. Passengers might recover more if they can show the airline was at fault for the crash, as the Machorros allege. 
  
 The crash ""occurred due to the gross negligence and recklessness of the Asiana flight crew on Flight 214,"" reads the complaint, ""in woeful violation of numerous international and United States airline industry standards and established flight rules."" 
  
 The Montreal Convention allows victims of the crash to sue Asiana in U.S. courts if they are permanent U.S. residents, purchased tickets in the U.S. or were flying into the U.S. as a final destination. All three plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, according to the suit. 
  
 Litigation over air disasters typically takes months or longer to unfold. Often, lawsuits are consolidated and handled by a single federal judge, a process known as multidistrict litigation. 
  
 Ladd Sanger, an aviation lawyer and commercially rated pilot in Dallas, said this would likely happen to any suits related to the Asiana incident. ""We're going to see a lot of these filed in the weeks to come,"" he said. ""This is probably the first of many."" 
  
 The crash has stoked a long-running debate over how aggressively plaintiff attorneys are permitted to seek out clients after an aviation tragedy. 
  
 Federal law mandates what is effectively a 45-day moratorium, during which lawyers are barred from directly soliciting to represent commercial air-crash victims or their families. The restrictions often aren't enforced effectively, and veteran lawyers are replete with stories about how the rules have been skirted. 
  
 But in the case of the Asiana crash, federal accident investigators and local law-enforcement appear to have tried particularly hard to make lawyers toe the line. 
  
 James Kreindler, a veteran aviation litigator with the New York law firm Kreindler and Kreindler LLP, said he has never experienced such a show of force by local police to keep certain lawyers from entering the hotel where many family members were staying after the Asiana crash. 
  
 ""I've never seen such tight controls,"" he said. ""You couldn't get through the front door unless you had a prearranged meeting with a specific hotel guest."" 
  
 Mr. Kreindler said he supports such restrictions because it prevents lawyers from trying to land clients with unfounded or exaggerated promises. 
  
 The NTSB also stepped up its game. Several days after the crash, the agency's general counsel's office sent out a mass email to members of the San Francisco Bar Association about the 45-day rule. 
  
 ""We are closely following the activities of attorneys,"" the message said, ""and will immediately notify state bar ethics officials and other appropriate authorities if impermissible activity is suspected."" 
  
 A spokeswoman for the NTSB said ""it is typical for local law enforcement to secure the family center,"" or hotel where family members are housed.

 A version of this article appeared July 18, 2013, on page A5 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Asiana Jet Passengers File Suit. ||||| South Korea's transport ministry said Thursday it asked Asiana Airlines Inc. to review safety measures two months before an Asiana flight crash-landed in San Francisco. 
  
 Kwon Yong Bok, director general of aviation safety policy at the transport ministry, said the government informed Asiana on April 30 it should hire more pilots, engineers and cabin crew as the airline planned to increase its fleet of airplanes by 20 percent by 2017. It currently has 80 planes. 
  
 ""We asked the company to review its safety policies once again,"" Kwon said by phone. 
  
 He said the ministry also recommended that Asiana centralize its safety management system and set up an oversight team for aircraft maintenance. 
  
 The recommendations were made as part of a safety consulting program that the ministry set up for the airline industry to minimize the risk of accidents. 
  
 Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed at San Francisco's international airport on July 6, killing three people and injuring dozens. Twelve people are still hospitalized including five cabin crew, South Korea's transport ministry said Monday. 
  
 The crash of the Boeing 777 was Asiana's first accident since a cargo plane landed in waters near South Korea's Jeju island in 2011, killing two pilots. Its deadliest plane accident was in 1993 when a domestic flight crashed south of Seoul, killing 66 people. 
  
 The cause of the San Francisco accident is still being probed but investigators have so far found no evidence of mechanical problems with the plane. ||||| A Chicago law firm has taken steps to sue Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, alleging that a malfunction of the plane's autothrottle may have caused the crash. 
  
 Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery, which is meant to preserve evidence, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where the aircraft manufacturer is headquartered. The firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days. 
  
 In addition to potential problems with the Boeing 777's auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seatbelts with a knife, the firm contends. 
  
 Three Chinese teenage girls were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6, approached the runway too low and slow. The plane clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire. 
  
 ""We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,"" attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement. 
  
 Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment. 
  
 The petition asks a judge to order Boeing to identify the designer and manufacturer of the airplane's autothrottle and its emergency evacuation slides. It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground. Kelly said the firm wants to protect the wreckage ""from destructive testing"" and to obtain maintenance records, internal memos and other evidence. 
  
 A passenger filed a lawsuit against Asiana in San Francisco federal court on Monday, saying the airline showed ""wanton and willful disregard for the rights and safety of all passengers,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Younga Jun Machorro and her 8-year-old son, Benjamin Machorro, were seated toward the front of the plane and both suffered back and neck injuries, their lawyer, Michael Verna, told the newspaper. 
  
 The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 have told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed. Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been ""armed,"" or made ready for activation, but investigators are still determining whether it had been engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board has said. 
  
 Two of the plane's eight slides malfunctioned, opening inside the cabin and pinning two flight attendants underneath. ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, seen at San Francisco International Airport, in San Francisco, Friday, July 12, 2013.

 The four pilots of the Asiana jet that crash-landed in San Francisco are being treated for psychological trauma and injuries caused by the accident, South Korean officials said Wednesday. 
  
 The Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry officials said the pilots have been hospitalized following medical checkups after returning home over the weekend. 
  
 Asiana Flight 214 crashed July 6 at San Francisco International Airport, killing three and injuring dozens. 
  
 The pilots underwent questioning by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and South Korean investigators while in the United States. 
  
 South Korean officials plan to conduct a separate interview with them. The ministry officials said that could begin as early as Friday if the doctors allow it. 
  
 The officials gave no further details and spoke on condition of anonymity, citing department rules. 
  
 Meantime, Asiana Airlines said Wednesday it no longer plans to sue a San Francisco TV station over the use of racially offensive names. 
  
 The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for the four pilots.

"SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his front-line military units to go on a “semi-war state” on Friday after South Korea said the two Koreas had exchanged rocket and artillery fire in the first major armed clash across their border in five years. 
  
 No casualties were immediately reported from the exchange of fire that took place across one of the world’s most heavily armed borders on Thursday. But tensions remained high on Friday, as Mr. Kim ordered his front-line units to be prepared to attack South Korean loudspeakers along the border unless they stopped blaring propaganda broadcasts by Saturday evening. 
  
 South Korea, currently in the middle of large-scale joint military exercises with the United States, rejected the North Korean demand. Instead it stepped up its own military vigilance, vowing to retaliate against any provocations from the North. 
  
 Mr. Kim ordered all front-line units to go on a “semi-war state,” one of his country’s highest military alerts, from 5 p.m. Friday during an emergency meeting of his Central Military Commission, the north’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday. ||||| SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's military fired dozens of shells Thursday at rival North Korea after the North lobbed a single artillery round at a South Korean border town, the South's Defense Ministry said. 
  
 The ministry said in a statement that its artillery landed at the place where North Korea had fired its shell. There were no other immediate details from the military, but it appeared that North Korea did not respond to South Korea's returned fire. 
  
 About 80 residents in the South Korean town where the shell fell, Yeoncheon, were evacuated to underground bunkers, and authorities urged other residents to evacuate, a Yeoncheon official said, requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. He said there were no reports of injuries or damage in Yeoncheon. 
  
 In the nearby border city of Paju, residents were asked to stay home, officials said. 
  
 North Korea had previously threatened to attack South Korean loudspeakers that have been broadcasting, for the first time in 11 years, anti-Pyongyang propaganda messages across their shared border. Pyongyang also restarted its own loudspeakers aimed at the South. 
  
 The cross-border propaganda warfare followed accusations from Seoul that Pyongyang had planted land mines on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone that maimed two South Korean soldiers last week. 
  
 Authoritarian North Korea is extremely sensitive to any criticism of the government run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since it was founded in 1948. 
  
 North Korea's army said previously in a statement that the broadcasts were a declaration of war and that if they were not immediately stopped ""an all-out military action of justice"" would ensue. 
  
 South Korean President Park Geun-hye urged Pyongyang to ""wake up"" from the delusion that it could maintain its government with provocation and threats. 
  
 Pyongyang's powerful National Defense Commission had claimed that Seoul fabricated the evidence on the land mines and demanded video proof. The land mine explosions resulted in one soldier losing both legs and another soldier one leg. ||||| (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered front-line military units to enter ""a wartime state"" after an exchange of fire with South Korea, his country's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. 
  
 The announcement, employing bellicose language typical of North Korea , adds to the edgy situation in the region. 
  
 The two sides traded artillery fire over their heavily fortified border on Thursday afternoon, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. 
  
 Two shells came from the North Korean side, the ministry said, and South Korea fired dozens of shells in response. 
  
 No casualties were reported from the exchange of fire. 
  
 North Korea hasn't given a detailed account of events, but the KCNA report Friday accused South Korea of committing a ""military provocation."" 
  
 Kim presided over an emergency meeting of the North's Central Military Commission late Thursday, issuing an order that the army's ""front-line large combined units"" should ""enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations,"" KCNA said. 
  
 He also ordered that ""the area along the front be put in a semi-war state,"" according to the report. The measures are to take effect from 5 p.m. Friday local time. 
  
 Theatrical conflict? 
  
 It's hardly the first time North Korea has used such alarming language. 
  
 During a period of heightened tensions in the region in 2013, North Korea announced it had entered ""a state of war"" with South Korea. That situation didn't result in military clashes.

 Jamie Metzl, an Asia expert for the Atlantic Council in New York, said he thought it was unlikely that the current crisis would escalate further. 
  
 ""North Korea has more to gain from conflict theater than from a conflict that would quickly expose its fundamental weakness,"" he said. 
  
 South Korea, a key U.S. ally where roughly 28,000 American troops are based, said it's on high alert after the exchange of fire. 
  
 The Pentagon is also monitoring the situation closely, said Cmdr. William Urban, a Defense Department spokesman. 
  
 Tensions spiked on the Korean Peninsula after two South Korean soldiers were seriously wounded by landmines on August 4 in the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries. 
  
 South Korea has accused the North of deliberately planting the mines, an allegation that Pyongyang denies. 
  
 North Korean threats over loudspeakers 
  
 Seoul vowed a ""harsh"" response to the landmines and resumed blaring propaganda messages over the border from huge loudspeakers last week. 
  
 The move infuriated North Korea, which called the broadcasting ""a direct action of declaring a war."" Over the weekend, it threatened to blow up the South Korean speakers and also warned of ""indiscriminate strikes."" 
  
 A U.S. official told CNN that the United States believes that North Korea fired at a South Korean loudspeaker on Thursday. 
  
 South Korea said that North Korea sent a written message around 5 p.m. Thursday local time threatening military action if Seoul doesn't stop the propaganda broadcasts within 48 hours and remove the loudspeakers. 
  
 A South Korean Defense Ministry official warned Friday that Seoul would retaliate strongly to any additional North Korean provocations. 
  
 On Monday, North Korea pumped its own propaganda broadcasts over the border , the same day South Korea started military exercises with the United States and other countries. Pyongyang says it views the drills as a prelude to an invasion. 
  
 The North Korean government asked this week that the exercises, which it described as ""serious provocations"" be placed on the U.N. Security Council's agenda. Pyongyang has made similar requests before without success. 
  
 A history of clashes 
  
 While the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula are unsettling, they're not without precedent. 
  
 In November 2010, North Korea shelled an island near the countries' disputed maritime border, killing two South Korean marines. 
  
 The two sides also traded fire in October 2014. A clash took place between patrol boats in the Yellow Sea, and then another flared days later over land after North Korean gunners apparently targeted balloons carrying leaflets critical of the country's reclusive regime. 
  
 Over the past six decades, skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders as each state aims to reunify the peninsula according to its own terms and system of government. Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002 and 2009. 
  
 Following Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea became a divided nation -- the capitalist South supported by the United States and its Western allies, and the communist North an ally of the Soviet Union. 
  
 Cold War tensions erupted into war in 1950, devastating the peninsula and taking the lives of as many as 2 million people. The fighting ended in 1953 with a truce, not a treaty, and settled little. 
  
 Technically, the two Koreas are still at war. 
  
 Besides the border skirmishes, other incidents have proved provocative. In 1968, North Korea dispatched commandos in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate South Korea's President. In 1983, a bombing linked to Pyongyang killed 17 high-level South Korean officials on a visit to Myanmar. In 1987, the North was accused of bombing a South Korean airliner. |||||

"Article: These romantic feelings that you now have for your friend are likely making you a bit anxious.  However, it is important that you stay calm so that you don’t make your friend nervous, too.  Take some deep breaths when you see them or when your heart starts to race.  Choose your words carefully and speak slowly.  Try not to allow your thoughts of them to consume your day; continue taking care of yourself and your responsibilities.  If thoughts of them are taking over your mind, distract yourself. Hang out with friends or family who aren't connected to your best friend. Get a project done that gets your body moving, like cleaning the house or painting your room. Begin to set the tone for a potential romance through flirtation.  Flirt with them slightly on occasion to assess their feelings for you.  If they flirt back with you, this will help you be more confident in asking them out.  Lean into them slightly when they are speaking. Look softly at them in their eyes for a few seconds. Smile brightly when you first see them. Laugh at their jokes. Put your hand on their shoulder when laughing. You can also hug them when you see them and when you are about to leave. Most people like to be complimented, so use this to your advantage while letting them know that you admire them.  If they look nice, let them know.  If they do well on on assignment at work or school, let them know that you respect their intellect and diligence. You can also begin to hint at you two going on a date.  By doing this, you can better gauge their interest in becoming romantic with you and you can determine how to move forward. You might say something like “You know, everyone keeps asking if we date.  Do people ask you that a lot, too?” Remember that physical attraction is critical in establishing a romance.  Take special care of your hygiene, hair and clothes, particularly while you are trying to garner their romantic interest.  Perhaps they like a certain scent; try to wear that fragrance more often.

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.  - Undecimber or Undecember is a name for a thirteenth month in a calendar that normally has twelve months . Duodecember is similarly a fourteenth month .  - A day is a unit of time. In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a ""solar day"". Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement ""day"", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized ""d"", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word ""day"" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, ""On which day?"" The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).  - A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; ""month"" and ""Moon"" are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.  - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions.  - A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the globe, four seasons are generally recognized: ""spring"", ""summer"", ""autumn"" and ""winter"". In tropical and subtropical regions several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual ""wet"" and ""dry"" seasons are recognized and tracked.  - A week is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of work days and rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside (but not strictly part of) the Gregorian calendar.    'undecimber' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?  Choices: - age  - base  - calendar  - calendar date  - change  - component  - concept  - course  - day  - day of the week  - designation  - globe  - gregorian calendar  - interval  - material  - measurement  - month  - motion  - period  - quantity  - seven  - si base unit  - single  - soil  - species  - standard  - three  - time  - unit of time  - word  - year

Plot title: Sometimes They Come Back Movie plot: Jim Norman, 36, a high school history teacher, moves back to his old hometown after accepting a teaching job there. He moved from the town after he witnessed his brother, Wayne, murdered by a gang of greasers in 1963. The murderers themselves were killed shortly afterward by an oncoming train, having parked on the tracks. Jim has nightmares about his brother's murder as he starts teaching in the town. Students that are close to him start to be involved in various accidents that look like suicides. One by one, students are slain so the greasers, disguised as living teens, can return to class. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne to keep themselves out of Hell. They intend to have a child witness the event, leading them to try to kidnap Jim's son Scott. Jim finds out that there is a way to let his own brother return. The gang also needs the remaining living member of their gang, Carl Mueller, who left before the train struck. Jim finds Carl, who panics, thinking Jim wants revenge. He runs back to town, fulfilling the gang's plan for a reunion. The gang harasses Jim's family to ensure Jim's compliance in reenacting the murder. After the gang releases the family, Jim hides them inside a church, which the demonic gang cannot enter. Jim tries to bring his brother back in the church's graveyard as the gang lures his wife and son outside and hold them hostage. Jim finds that something is blocking Wayne's return, and must cooperate with the thugs in reenacting the murder. It also reveals that when Jim was a boy, Jim took the murderers' car keys that lead to their deaths. Jim recovered the keys. He returns to the train tunnel in which the first murder took place, though both he and Carl change their dialogue and actions from those taken 27 years before. Frustrated, the gang leader stabs Carl, which allows Wayne to come back. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's car. Jim gave the gang back their car keys.

"Here is a news article: Lowe’s Cos. Inc. says it will phase out the sale of products and plants that contain pesticides linked to deaths of honey bees and other pollinators, becoming what is believed to be the largest retailer to take such a move. 
  
 The company’s announcement comes days after the release of a study by the European Academies Science Advisory Council that said the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is harmful to a range of helpful insects and organisms, not just honeybees. 
  
 The paper joins a long list of studies critical of the pesticides currently banned in Europe but widely used in North America. 
  
 Agricultural groups and the chemical companies that make the pesticides say they are safe and effective protection against harmful insects if used properly, and that honeybee populations are thriving. But some beekeepers and scientists say the chemicals are killing bees and other insects by compounding the effects of virus-bearing mites and other threats. 
  
 North Carolina-based Lowe’s said the studies on neonicotinoids are inconclusive, and it was taking the steps “out of an abundance of caution.” 
  
 In its 2014 Report on Social Responsibility released on Thursday, the company said it will work with the growers of its plants to eliminate the use of neonics and phase out within two years sales of lawn and garden pesticides that contain neonics. 
  
 “Our direction regarding neonics doesn’t imply that there is anything wrong or unsafe with our current products,” said Karen Cobb, a spokeswoman for the store that has 1,840 outlets in North America. “Products available at Lowe’s are U.S. EPA-approved to be safe and effective when used according to manufacturer’s directions.” 
  
 Ontario last month said it planned to have rules in place by this summer that would reduce by 80 per cent the use of neonics on corn and soybean by 2017. The regulations would restrict the prophylactic use of seed treatments in an effort to ensure they are used only in areas prone to crop-destroying insects. 
  
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last week it will no longer approve new uses for neonics pending further study of the effects on bees and other pollinators. 
  
 Environmental group Friends of the Earth last year released a study that showed 51 per cent of the plants and flowers sold at major garden stores in Canada and the United States contained neonics. “All of those plants were labelled ‘bee friendly,’ but were treated without any warning to consumers,” said Tiffany Finck-Haynes of Friends of the Earth. 
  
 Home Depot has said it would begin labelling plants that contained or were grown using the pesticides. “We offer our customers the ability to choose from a variety of lawn and garden products and currently carry over 40 environmentally preferred alternatives. In addition we are actively working with our live goods suppliers to find alternative insecticides for protecting live goods and bees,” Home Depot said in an e-mail on Thursday. 
  
 “What makes Lowe’s unique is they are the largest retailer [to] make a time-bound commitment, whereas Home Depot said they are labelling their plants and working with their suppliers to find safer alternatives, [but] they haven’t made any time-bound public commitments on how they are actually phasing out neonics on their plants and on their off-the-shelf products,” Ms. Finck-Haynes said by phone. 
  
 Bayer, which makes neonic-based pesticides used by farmers and gardeners, did not respond to an interview request. ||||| CHICAGO Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc will stop selling a type of pesticide suspected of causing a decline in honeybee populations needed to pollinate key American crops, following a few U.S. retailers who have taken similar steps last year. 
  
 The class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or neonics, are sold by agrichemical companies to boost yields of staple crops but are also used widely on annual and perennial plants used in lawns and gardens. 
  
 Scientists, consumer groups, beekeepers and others say bee deaths are linked to the neonic pesticides. The bee die-off is worrisome for agriculture because honeybees pollinate plants that produce about a fourth of the food consumed by Americans. 
  
 Lowe's said it will phase out neonics in shelf products and plants by the spring of 2019, as suitable alternatives become available. 
  
 A study released by environment group Friends of the Earth and Pesticide Research Institute in 2014 showed that 51 percent of garden plants purchased at Lowe's, Home Depot and Walmart in 18 cities in the United States and Canada contained neonicotinoid pesticides at levels that could harm or even kill bees. 
  
 In 2014, the White House announced a plan to fund new honeybee habitats and to form a task force to study how to reverse the honeybee declines. 
  
 Last year, BJ's Wholesale Club, a warehouse retailer said it was asking all of its vendors to provide plants free of neonics by the end of 2014 or to label such products. 
  
 Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain, also asked its suppliers to start labeling any plants treated with neonics and that it was running tests in several states to see if suppliers can eliminate neonics in their plant production without hurting plant health.

The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - The Palme d'Or is the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival. It was introduced in 1955 by the organising committee. From 1939 to 1954, the highest prize was the ""Grand Prix du Festival International du Film"".   - Bille August (born 9 November 1948) is a Danish Academy Award-winning film and television director. His film ""Pelle the Conqueror"" from 1987 won the Palme d'Or, Academy Award and Golden Globe.

"I know that the answer to the question ""What used Avestan?"" is in ""The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as ""Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan"", and ""Younger Avestan"". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its ""old"" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes)."".

"Given the following context:  On the last day of British rule in Hong Kong late 1997, Detective Inspector Lee of the Hong Kong Police Force leads a raid at a shipping bar wharf, hoping to arrest the mysterious crime lord Juntao. He finds only Sang, Juntao's right-hand man, who manages to escape. However, Lee successfully recovers numerous Chinese cultural treasures stolen by Juntao, which he presents as a farewell victory to his departing superiors: Chinese Consul Solon Han and British Commander Thomas Griffin. Shortly after Han arrives in the United States to take up his new diplomatic post in Los Angeles, his daughter, Soo Yung, is kidnapped by Sang while on her way to her first day of school. The FBI informs Consul Han about the incident. Han calls in Lee to assist in the case. The FBI, afraid that the injury or death of Lee would result in negative attention internationally, decides to pawn him off on the LAPD just to keep him out of their way. The selfish, stubborn, and maverick Detective James Carter is tricked into doing this but Carter makes a plan to solve the case himself when he finds out that he has been given a boring task as punishment for botching a sting operation. Carter meets Lee at Los Angeles International Airport and proceeds to take him on a sightseeing tour of LA, simultaneously keeping Lee away from the embassy and contacting several of his underworld informants about the kidnapping. Lee finally escapes and makes his way to the Chinese Consulate, where a nervous Han and a group of FBI agents are awaiting news about his daughter. While arguing with Agent-in-charge Warren Russ, Carter accidentally involves himself in a phone conversation with Sang, where he arranges a ransom drop of $50 million in a couple of hours.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who goes to Los Angeles for a diplomatic post?

"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In suburban Chicago, high school senior Ferris Bueller fakes sickness to stay home. Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned. Borrowing Cameron's father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder against Cameron's instinct, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane drive into Chicago to sightsee. Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field. They then go to a French restaurant for lunch where Ferris poses as the ""Sausage King of Chicago"", Abe Froman, while narrowly avoiding his father, who is eating lunch at the restaurant. Meanwhile, after humiliatingly failing to find Ferris, Rooney visits the Bueller residence and fails to enter, being attacked by the family rotweiller as his car is towed. Jeannie, skipping class, returns home and discovers her brother's ruse, but encounters Rooney snooping. She kicks him and calls the police, who arrest her for false reporting after Rooney leaves. While at the station, Jeannie meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris. After a cab ride where Cameron exclaims disinterest, Ferris impromptu joins a parade float during the Von Steuben Day parade and lip-syncs Wayne Newton's cover of ""Danke Schoen"", as well as a rendition of The Beatles' ""Twist and Shout"" that gets the entire crowd dancing.

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - London Scottish Football Club is a rugby union club in England. The club is a member of both the Rugby Football Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. The club shares the Athletic Ground with Richmond.  - The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), or ""Aonadh Rugbaidh na h-Alba"" in Scottish Gaelic, is the governing body of rugby union in Scotland. It is the second oldest Rugby Union, having been founded in 1873, as the Scottish Football Union. The SRU oversees the national league system, known as the Scottish League Championship. The SRU is headed by the President (Ed Crozier) and Chairman (Sir Moir Lockhead), with Mark Dodson acting as the Chief Executive Officer.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it ""Londinium"". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, ""London"" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.  - William Edward `` Bill '' Maclagan ( 5 April 1858 -- 10 October 1926 ) was a Scottish international rugby union forward who played club rugby for London Scottish F.C. . Maclagan was one of the longest - serving international rugby players during the early development of the sport , and was awarded 25 caps for Scotland . He played international rugby for thirteen seasons , a Scottish record for sixty years , and led the first official British Isles team on its 1891 tour of South Africa . Maclagan 's contributions to the early development of rugby were recognised in 2009 with his induction into the IRB Hall of Fame .  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.  - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area.  - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the governing body for rugby union in England. It was founded in 1871, and was the sport's international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886. It promotes and runs the sport, organises international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials.  - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'sport'.

Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, he debuted in the comic book Giant-Size X-Men #1 (May 1975). Nightcrawler is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman agility, the ability to teleport, and adhesive hands and feet.

In the 2008 miniseries X-Infernus, Pixie summons her Souldagger and stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removes her Souldagger, Magik's Soulsword emerges from his chest.  Magik teleports away after taking out Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide, and Beast. Kurt wakes up and stops Pixie from going after her and Pixie breaks down and apologizes for stabbing him. Later the X-Men gather and Kurt is put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik.  Upon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fight their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her Souldagger.  Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar and she asks him to stab her with Pixie's Souldagger, as it's the only way and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic.He apologizes and he stabs her; at that moment Colossus punches Kurt, and Witchfire finishes making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie.  The fact however that Colossus and Wolverine have not killed him, makes Kurt realize they are not fully under her control. Using Pixie's Dagger, Kurt then pulls Illyana's Soulsword from her, and uses it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire's control. Unfortunately, the demon manages to use the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie flees. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoles Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleports them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinces her to stay with them and join the X-Men.

Obama administration reportedly readies proposed expansion of background checks

Advisers to President Barack Obama reportedly are finalizing a proposal to expand background checks on would-be gun buyers without congressional approval.

The Associated Press reported that White House adviser Valerie Jarrett told a Wednesday night vigil for victims of the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. that Obama had asked his team to complete a proposal and submit it for his review ""in short order.""

After October's mass shooting in Roseburg, Ore., Obama said his team was looking for ways to tighten gun laws without a vote in Congress. White House officials have said they're exploring closing the so-called ""gun show loophole"" that allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check.

Obama has repeatedly called for tighter gun control measures in the wake of mass shooting during his administration. In the wake of last week's terror attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. Obama called on Congress to approve legislation to keep people on the no-fly list from buying guns. Gun rights advocates oppose the proposal because they say it violates the rights of people who have not been convicted of a crime.

On Thursday, the House rejected an attempt by Democrats to force a vote on the issue. A Senate version of legislation preventing suspected terrorists from being allowed to buy firearms from licensed gun dealers was voted down last week.

Also Thursday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy proposed Thursday to use an executive order to ban gun sales to those on federal no-fly watch lists.

However, despite repeatedly calls for gun control by Democrats at the state and federal level, gun sales have repeatedly spiked after mass shooting incidents.

The FBI said last week that it processed a record number of firearms background checks on Black Friday, the busy shopping time the day after Thanksgiving. The agency processed 185,345 background checks. roughly two per second.

The previous record for the most background checks in a single day was Dec. 21, 2012, about a week after the Newtown shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were shot to death. The week following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary saw the processing of 953,613 gun background checks.

Context: Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area, including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded.

"Information:  - Aristotle (""Aristotéls""; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Zeus (""Zeús"", ; Modern , ""Días"" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.  - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means ""ponder"" and ""contemplation"" in Greek.  - Mnemosyne (or  ), source of the word ""mnemonic"", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:  - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / (  ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory .  - Anaximander (""Anaximandros""; c. 610  c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.  - In Greek mythology, Aoede (""Aoid"") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.   - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses ""beginning"", ""origin"" or ""source of action"". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean ""first place, power"", ""method of government"", ""empire, realm"", ""authorities"" (in plural: ), ""command"". The first principle or element corresponds to the ""ultimate underlying substance"" and ""ultimate undemonstrable principle"". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), ""arche"" (or ""archai"") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of ""arche"" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

"The decision comes as the majority councils are increasing the charge, many by the maximum 4.99%.
It is the second consecutive year the Conservative-run authority has reduced its share of the charge.
The council says it eventually aims to cut council tax to zero and free itself from relying on government grants by becoming financially independent.
Council leader Ferris Cowper said: ""We have shown it is possible for councils to make their own money, without increasing the tax burden on their residents and without cutting services.""
East Hampshire District Council has been marketing its services to other authorities to bring in extra income - departments including planning, regeneration and communications are expected to generate nearly £1m this financial year.
The authority has also bought a number of commercial properties, including the Iceland store in Alton, which in total, it says, generate nearly £850,000 a year for its services.

Plot title: Safety Not Guaranteed Movie plot: Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) is a disillusioned college graduate who lives at home with her widower father (Jeff Garlin) and interns at Seattle Magazine. One of the magazine's writers, Jeff Schwensen (Jake Johnson), proposes to investigate a newspaper classified ad that reads:[8] Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before. Jeff's story idea is approved by his boss, Bridget (Mary Lynn Rajskub). Jeff selects his team, made up of Darius and a man named Arnau (Karan Soni), the latter of whom is a studious biology major interning at the magazine to diversify his resume. They travel to the seaside community of Ocean View to find and profile the person behind the ad. Jeff later reveals an ulterior motive for this assignment: to track down a long-lost love interest who lives in town. Darius discovers that the person behind the ad is Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), a stock clerk at a local grocery store. Jeff's attempt to approach Kenneth alienates him, so Jeff orders Darius to make contact. Darius' disaffected attitude serves her well, and she quickly endears herself to Kenneth as she poses as a candidate to accompany him on his mission. While Kenneth is paranoid and believes that ""secret agents"" are tracking his every move, Darius gains his trust as she participates in a series of training exercises in the woods around his house and begins to develop feelings for him. She tells Kenneth about the death of her mother when she was young and that her mission is to prevent it. Kenneth says his mission is to go back to 2001 and prevent the death of his old girlfriend Belinda, who was killed when someone drove a car into her house. Meanwhile, Jeff tracks down Liz (Jenica Bergere), his fling from his teenage years; although she is not as attractive as his memories of her younger self, they reconnect and sleep together. He asks her to come back with... My question: Where does Darius intern at?

"TV - FOR BARYSHNIKOV, IT'S A HOLLYWOOD NIGHT - NYTimes.com
MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV has used television well in his ascent to superstardom. He has recorded a few ballet programs for public television. He did ''The Nutcracker'' for CBS-TV. His ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' special deservedly won a slew of awards. And now, in the same showcase vein, he is starring at 10 o'clock tonight on CBS in ''Baryshnikov in Hollywood.''

''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' it isn't. The first special combined low-key charm with New York sophistication as it reviewed great stage musicals, from ''Oklahoma!'' to ''A Chorus Line.'' The new production, produced and directed by Don Mischer, focuses on the nutty superficiality of Hollywood. Mr. Baryshnikov and company - including Dom DeLuise, Shirley MacLaine, Bernadette Peters, Charles Nelson Reilly, Gene Wilder and, as the unseen narrator, Orson Welles - are limited largely to tongue-in-cheek romping, all of which is executed marvelously but finally tends to become a wee bit monotonous.

The dance star is seen closing a season in New York and preparing for a Caribbean vacation. Enter the maniacal Mr. DeLuise as a producer determined to lure Mr. Baryshnikov to Silver Screen fame. ''Dancers always have trouble with their feet,'' the producer observes, ''actors hardly even have corns.'' In Hollywood, Mr. Baryshnikov is sent to a dialogue coach for his accent, but spends most of his performing time in nonspeaking roles, going from ''The Sheik'' and ''The Pirate'' to a casual but energetic history of old musicals.

Dedicated with love and affection to James Cagney, the show is nearly always pleasant and, with choreography by Michael Kidd and Peter Anastos, never less than ebullient. That is one of the problems. When Mr. Baryshnikov takes time out for a quiet moment, recalling in acting class an incident from his childhood, it turns out to be the highlight of the hour. For the much of the rest of the time, he smiles impishly, is charmingly boyish and dances superbly. Doubtless, he will yet become America's sweetheart.

With the season's audience-popularity ratings race just about settled - CBS on top, NBC on the bottom -and with another sweeps period, crucial to local stations and their advertising rates, about a week away, the schedule is heavy these days with documentaries, always the least likely candidates to attract massive audiences. One that sticks out from the others, however, is ''People Like Us,'' on CBS tonight at 8 o'clock. There is one overriding reason - the presence of Bill D. Moyers who, virtually alone among network correspondents, is allowed to bring a personal vision and voice to his reports.

This time around, Mr. Moyers looks at the country's truly needy, the people who President Reagan said would not be hurt by cutbacks in Federal spending. The correspondent does not bombard the viewer with statistics, charts and man-in-the-street interviews. He simply interviews four very different people: a victim of cerebral palsy cut off the Social Security disability rolls, the mother of three children forced to give up a low-paying job and go back on welfare, a mother reluctantly sending her paralyzed daughter to a hospital because of changes in the Government rules for home health care and a priest overseeing free meals at his church, where the number of hungry guests has doubled in the last year.

Mr. Moyers does what he does best - talking directly to the people. He sits with distraught families, he strolls with a gently optimistic youth, he probes the feelings of those forced to take charity. The camerawork of Tom Spain and Rick Thompson captures fleeting expressions that tell more than volumes of statistics. Mr. Moyers is fair to all sides, but he refuses to come down in the middle of the nowhere sometimes called ''balance.'' In his concluding remarks, he says:

''There's no question but that Federal programs which help the poor are riddled with waste and fraud. So are programs that help the middle class. So are subsidies to corporations. So are the billions being spent on the military-industrial complex. But the President and the Congress have chosen not to offend the rich, the powerful and the organized. It is easier to take on the poor. They have been asked to sacrifice because the economy is in trouble and because some people are cheating the system. But for all the fraud and waste, for all their inefficiencies, these programs are a life-support system for the poor. For many, we are pulling the program.''

In the too often anonymous world of television, Mr. Moyers has managed to develop and, more significantly, retain a distinctive presence.

"Migration Period art denotes the artwork of the Germanic peoples during the Migration period (ca. 300-900). It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style.

The study of Northern European, or ""Germanic"", zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by Bernhard Salin in a work published in 1904. He classified animal art of the period roughly from 400 to 900 into three phases: Styles I, II and III. The origins of these different phases are still the subject of considerable debate; the development of trends in late-Roman popular art in the provinces is one element, and the older traditions of nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples another. The first two styles are found very widely across Europe in the art of the ""barbarian"" peoples of the Migration Period.  Style I. First appears in northwest Europe, it became a noticeable new style with the introduction of the chip carving technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.  Style II. After about 560-570 Style I was in decline and Salin's Style II began to replace it. Style II's animals are whole beasts, but their bodies are elongated into ""ribbons"" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretence of naturalism, and rarely any legs, so that they tend to be described as serpents, although the heads often have characteristics of other types of animal. The animal becomes subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically using interlace. Thus two bears are facing each other in perfect symmetry (""confronted""), forming the shape of a heart. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid.  After about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style. Salin Style III is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called Viking art.

Wear vinyl or latex gloves when you check for bedbugs. This can protect your hands from being bitten by live bed bugs and the gloves will prevent you from coming into contact with blood from smashed bed bugs. If you don't have any gloves around, wrap a plastic bag over your hand before looking for the bed bugs. Adult bed bugs are around 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) long and they have 6 legs. A bed bug that's recently fed on blood will be bright red and round. Once it digests the blood, it will turn a darker brown color and become flat. If the bed bug hasn't fed in a while, it will be a pale brown color. Since bed bugs feed on blood, they can leave behind red or rusty stains if they get smashed. The color may be bright red if the bed bug was recently crushed or the stain may be dark if the bed bug was smashed a while ago. The stains might look like single drops of blood or there will be smears and streaks. Bed bug excrement will look like very small black spots (about this size: •). The excrement can stain the fabric that's underneath it, so you may see dark streaks as well. You should also look for small pale white eggs that are around 1 millimetre (0.10 cm) in size. You may also see pale skins that the bed bug nymphs shed as they grow larger.

"Firefighter Marc Hadden was working with the medical unit when he helped deliver the baby girl who would grow into the blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter he now knows as “Gracie.” 
  
 It was a surprisingly slow day for one of the busiest fire stations in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on November 11, 2011. Hadden had spent the day training and killing time cleaning engines. 
  
 When he finally sat down with his crew to eat dinner in the middle of his 24-hour shift, the phone rang — and he had to hop into an ambulance to make an emergency call. When he arrived on scene, he and his partner found a pregnant woman in labor. As soon as they helped her into the ambulance, she was ready to give birth. 
  
 Marc Hadden 
  
 It was the first time Hadden took charge during a delivery in his two decades of working. 
  
 “I was tasked with everything to do with Gracie,” Hadden told CBS News. “I helped her take her first breath.” 
  
 The team then called for backup and rushed to the hospital to drop off the mother and child. While filling out routine paperwork at the hospital, Hadden overheard nurses say the new mom requested the baby girl be put up for adoption “immediately.” 
  
 “Throw my name in the hat if this baby’s being put up for adoption,” Hadden said jokingly. 
  
 But he wasn’t actually kidding. 
  
 Due to medical complications, Hadden and his wife, Rebecca, weren’t able to have any more children after they had their second son. 
  
 “We checked into adopting, but it was way too expensive,” Hadden. “We prayed about it.” 
  
 The nurses turned to Hadden and said, “You need to go talk to this mom.” 
  
 Hesitantly, Hadden walked into the woman’s hospital room to introduce himself. He explained that he has two kids, his wife’s a school teacher and they want to have more children, but aren’t able to. After a friendly chat, Hadden swung by the nursery and sent his wife a picture of the smiley little girl. 
  
 She jokingly texted back, “Can we keep her?” 
  
 Marc Hadden 
  
 Hadden knew his wife wasn’t joking either. 
  
 Exhausted, Hadden headed home to talk to his wife in person. They both agreed, it was worth trying. What did they have to lose? 
  
 The next day, Rebecca visited the woman in the hospital. 
  
 “With both of our boys, we had families, support and a ton of stuff,” Hadden said. “This mom didn’t. She had nothing. No family that was there.” 
  
 As Rebecca started to walk out of the hospital, a doctor stopped her in the hallway and said, “She’s ready to go forward with the adoption.” 
  
 Marc Hadden 
  
 Forty-eight hours later, the Haddens had their little girl, and in March 2012 the closed adoption that the girl’s birth mom requested was complete. 
  
 “It was meant to be,” Hadden said. “Everything that happened that day changed: my station, assignment, the location. So many things happened that made us 100 percent sure.” 
  
 Marc Hadden 
  
 The family named their baby girl Rebecca Grace Hadden; she goes by Gracie. 
  
 “The name Grace over the years has become extremely fitting for her,” Hadden said of the now 5-year-old. “She’s an awesome kid.” 
  
 The 5-year-old girl loves playing with her brothers and dressing up with her mom, but she especially loves hearing the story of how her “daddy” delivered her in the back of an ambulance. 
  
 “Our bond is extremely tight. She’s a part of the family, and we love her more than life,” Hadden said. “We wouldn’t change anything. We would do it all again if we could.” ||||| Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter

 It's been more than five years since Marc Hadden, a firefighter in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, went on the emergency call that would change his life — and his family — forever. 
  
 ""It was a normal slow day in November,"" Hadden, 47, told TODAY. ""We were sitting down to eat, hadn't had a call all day."" 
  
 But then they got one — a woman was complaining of severe abdominal pain. When Hadden and the other firefighters arrived on scene, they quickly realized the woman was in labor. 
  
 Rebecca Grace Hadden, who goes by Grace, was born on November 14, 2011. Courtesy of the Hadden family 
  
 ""It was a pretty serious call for us,"" he said. ""We got her on some oxygen, started some IVs and literally as we were getting ready to leave the parking lot in the ambulance, my partner said, 'We're about to deliver a baby right here.' We had no time to prepare. Before we could do anything — we hadn't even cut her clothes — Gracie came right out. Immediately she was handed to me.""

 Of course, she wasn't known as Gracie then. Hadden and his wife, Beth, named her Rebecca Grace Hadden after they adopted her; she goes by her middle name. 
  
 At the hospital later on the day of Grace's birth, November 14, 2011, Hadden learned the woman, who he believes was homeless, was putting the infant up for adoption. Hadden and his wife, who had been praying for a third child, jumped at the opportunity. 
  
 Two days later, they took her home, and in March of 2012 they got full custody of Grace. Today, she is simply part of the family. 
  
 Grace fit right in with her family. Courtesy of the Hadden family 
  
 ""She's amazing,"" Hadden said. ""She takes gymnastics, she's getting ready to start kindergarten next year at the school where my wife teaches. She's a pretty remarkable kid."" 
  
 She also has two big brothers: Parker, 12, and Will, 14. 
  
 ""The boys absolutely love her and she loves them,"" said Hadden, who still works as a firefighter, but now on a volunteer basis. 
  
 Now Grace is a happy 5-year-old who loves gymnastics, soccer and hanging out with her brothers. Courtesy of the Hadden family 
  
 ""Most days it's business as usual, getting Gracie to day care or gymnastics or soccer,"" he added. ""Every once in a while it will hit us, usually when we're out on a date night ... oh my gosh, my wife and I have been together for 15 years, we have three kids now! Sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. Holy cow, this happened overnight, but we wouldn't trade it for anything.""

 Grace, now 5, knows her birth story. 
  
 ""We have never hidden it from her,"" Hadden said. ""If you ask her where she was born, she says, 'My daddy delivered me in the back of an ambulance.' She knows the whole story. I wanted her to know as soon as she was old enough to understand. I didn't want it to be this huge surprise. It still breaks my heart to think of one day having to explain it to her more in depth ... because she doesn't really 100% get it.""

 When that day comes, Hadden will surely be there for her. 
  
 ""Gracie and I have an amazing bond,"" he said. ""We're tighter than thieves."" 
  
 ""She is part of our family and that is absolutely the way it is,"" he added. ""We love her."" ||||| MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) From time to time, you hear a story of such amazing timing that it stops you in your tracks. The story of Grace, is one of them. 
  
 For first responder, Marc Hadden seeing the unusual is all in a day's work, but he never expected that taking this call would forever change his life. 
  
 ""911, what's your emergency?"" 
  
 It was a cool crisp November night when Marc Hadden and his crew arrived on scene. 
  
 ""It was just a somewhat normal call. Very quickly we realized that it was going to be a life changer for us,"" says firefighter, Marc Hadden. 
  
 There was no time to get to the hospital and before he knew it, Marc was delivering a baby girl. 
  
 ""He called me and he was ecstatic. I mean, he delivered a baby and who in the world gets to deliver a baby in their lifetime that's not a doctor?"" says wife, Beth Hadden. 
  
 Shortly after the amazing experience, the Haddens discovered Baby Grace was immediately put up for adoption, an unknown blessing for the family of four who always knew they wanted their family to grow, but couldn't. 
  
 ""Ever since we had the boys, we knew that we wanted more children,"" explains Beth. ""But I was pre-term with them so we knew that it wasn't possible to have any more babies. And we had it in our minds and in our hearts for years to adopt and we just left it in God's hands. We said if its meant to be, it will be."" 
  
 In a strange twist of fate, it was as if little Grace picked them. 
  
 ""I don't know if I have words. I never envisioned that I would have a daughter. We are truly blessed, for sure,"" says Marc. 
  
 Just 48 hours after the emergency call, their new bundle of joy wrapped in pink was coming home. 
  
 ""As soon as we signed the papers I looked a Marc and went, 'Oh my gosh, we have to pay for a wedding.' I was like, that was my first thought? I guess just having a girl is so different after having two boys,"" laughs Beth. 
  
 As for the boys, Will and Parker haven't skipped a beat taking on the roles as the protective, older brothers. They realize they may not share the same DNA as Grace, but the way they light up when they see her can only be described as true love. 
  
 ""I just love her to pieces,"" says big brother Will. 
  
 It's been nearly eight months now since little Grace miraculously fell right into her daddy's arms. The family of five is happy and healthy and life has proven once again that being in the right place at the right time can change everything. 
  
 Marc jokingly says, ""I've been telling people that, you know [that old saying], 'I brought her into this world and I can take her out' and I'll be able to tell her that."" 
  
 Most would say little Gracie was saved the night she was born, but the Haddens would argue it was Grace who saved them. 
  
 ""I don't even think about her being adopted. She's ours and we love her,"" says proud dad, Marc. 
  
 Making room for their bundle of joy 
  
 Word about the Haddens spread quickly after their appearance on WMBF News. 
  
 Their family was growing as Marc and Beth Hadden opened their arms, their hearts and their home to Grace, and that outpouring of love is contagious. 
  
 A friend of the family who has witnessed the tale of Haddens first hand wanted to pitch in and help, donating time and supplies to construct an expansion to their home. 
  
 The contractor Buddy Satterfield explains, ""It feels good to do something that we feel is relatively simple in the construction business, but it just means so much to somebody else. So it's just great to be able to pass on the blessing that has been sent to us."" 
  
  
  
 The new construction on the Haddens' home began on Monday, July 23 - and now on Tuesday - the additions are nearly complete. 
  
 The crew built a partition separating a dining area from the family room and creating a fourth bedroom. After some light vanity work, the room should be ready for use this weekend. 
  
 Proud father Marc Hadden cheers, ""I don't know what we would have done because we have definitely outgrown our home. So we're just truly blessed to have friends that will pull together for us like this.""

Question: Who kills clark? Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: At an officers club Anchorage Alaska, Ned ""Scotty"" Scott (Douglas Spencer) meets with a group of air force officers playing cards. Amid the small talk Scott tells the men that he is a reporter looking for a story. One of the officers admits that a large number of scientists are at the North Pole. Scotty takes an interest on the matter but nothing more is said.Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) is paged to General Fogarty's quarters. Fogarty explains that a strange aircraft has been found at the pole, Hendry is put in charge of the recovery mission. Remembering the earlier conversation he asks if Scott can fly up with the recovery team.Arriving at the pole they meet with the scientists who are excited about the potential of the find. Hendry catches up with a science assistant Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan). It is clear from their encounter they have an extensive social past.Nikki introduces Hendry to Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) leader of the scientist based at the north pole. Carrington tells Hendry the crashed aircraft is located about 48 miles from the base. When the plane crashed instruments recorded an explosion and magnetic flux disturbance that indicates the plane weighs approximately 20,000 tons.Hendry suggests that, given the recorded weight of the vessel, they must be dealing with a meteor. Carrington, however, shows him a number of radar tracks that show the object change course and speed a number of times before crashing.The expedition flies to the location to begin to unravel the mystery, as they approach the reported location the aircraft's compass begins to malfunction then Geiger counters begin registering erratic levels of radiation. Finally they see a teardrop-shaped area in the snow.Arriving at the actual crash site they realize whatever landed was so hot that it melted enough snow to sink down so that only a stabilizer fin is protruding from the ice. To establish the actual size of the craft the team slowly spreads out over the object. After a few minutes it becomes...

From the moment we checked in, we were treated poorly by the staff - the woman working the front desk asked us to take a seat while she ""saw what she could do"" about our reservation, even though we had successfully booked it prior to checking in and had the confirmation number in hand. What she actually did was check in every single person in line behind us, not bothering to address our reservation until we interrupted her and asked what was going on (a good 20 minutes later.) I'm not sure how us essentially losing our place in line translated as her ""seeing what she could do.""  But it gets worse. We had a few friends visit our room, and apparently the security guards saw them through our window (creepy much?)

"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: Who has a daughter named Lisa? from the following article ?  Tom Stansfield is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor. Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa, who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer. One of Tom's tasks is to guard their owl, O-J, which lives in an open cage (it has not been able to fly due to a deep depression, from the loss of a prior mate). When the bird drinks from the toilet polluted with drugs, it flies away. Jack's ex-secretary Audrey goes to the house to try to earn her job back. After fighting with her boyfriend, she stays over at the house. Lisa returns home after finding out that her boyfriend Hans is cheating on her. Tom hides from her everything that happened and she spends some time with her thinking he is homosexual. He clarifies to her that he's actually straight and she starts to like him.

I went for Sunday brunch and loved it. I thought the antique store part was fascinating and it has the added bonus of making any wait time for a table go by in a flash (there was also coffee you could help yourself to before being seated.) I saw some nice antique compacts and there were more vintage clothes than I expected, glass coffee pots, beautiful vintage chairs, etc. some of it is dusty and it's sort of a cozy clutter of oddities and antiques. Examples of the oddities are a literal shrine to the Steelers complete with kneeling bench, and glass table lamps filled with painted Barbies. The food though! It was really terrific, very flavorful, very filling. I was in a party of 2 and we were seated with some other guests at a large table. For $11.50 I got unlimited coffee & tea, an entree  from a small menu that I understand changes weekly and unlimited access to the 100% vegetarian (and vegan?) buffet. A dozen different bundt cakes to try, some of the best hummus I've ever eaten, salads, fruit, cilantro beans, a variety of cold pasta dishes, orzo, penne, peanut noodles, spicy green beans, chickpea salad, a great herbed potato salad with vinegar dressing...etc. I'm sure it changes every week so there's no use itemizing everything. I loved how everything was seasoned, no two dishes tasted too much alike; mostly basic ingredients that were well prepared with surprising variety, nourishing, and most importantly tasted really good. I loved the lack of tofu especially, not that I dislike tofu but it's everywhere. The seitan slices in my entree tasted great and not like they just slid them out of a can. Good times.

(CNN) -- One fateful consequence of President Bashar al-Assad's ferocious crackdown on Syrian protesters is the emergence of the domestic armed resistance, the Free Syrian Army. Forged in neighboring Turkey over the summer by military defectors, the FSA has become a major factor in the opposition to the regime. The grass-roots armed resistance is growing, attracting civilians as well as military defectors, and has become a thorn in the side of the Syrian military and the pro-regime militias, observers say. But it needs more personnel, better resources and improved coordination to take on the Syrian security presence, they add.

Plot title: Breach Movie plot: Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is a young FBI employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a sexual deviant. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly ""shoot guns"" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. He learns that FBI Director Louis Freeh is personally leading the investigation. While the FBI could arrest Hanssen under lesser charges, they want to catch him in an act of espionage, so they can threaten him with the death penalty for treason and possibly induce him to divulge the information he has compromised.

"Context: The McNabb-less Eagles travelled to Indiana to take on the 9-1 Indianapolis Colts. Any chances of victory would be reliant upon a strong defensive showing, but the Colts stormed ahead behind three rushing touchdowns by rookie Joseph Addai in the first two quarters.  Philadelphia's new starting quarterback, Jeff Garcia, found L.J. Smith for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 21-7 in the second quarter. Adam Vinatieri booted a 44-yard kick before the end of the half for Indianapolis. Peyton Manning tossed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne making it 31-7 Colts in the third quarter. The Eagles showed signs of life with touchdowns by Reggie Brown and Brian Westbrook to climb within ten with about ten minutes to play.  However, Addai scored his fourth touchdown of the game and a Garcia fumble led to a defensive touchdown for the Colts, making it 45-21 - a score representative of how overmatched the Eagles appeared all night. The Colts rushed for 237 yards on the Eagles' beleaguered defense. Westbrook had his third consecutive 100-yard game - the first Eagle to do that since Wilbert Montgomery 25 years ago. The loss drops the Eagles to under .500 for the first time all year.

"Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"Summarize this article:

The opening stage of the week-long event is the only one in Scotland.
The Grand Depart saw riders rolling out of Glasgow's George Square before doing a circuit of the city.
They headed south, and have taken in Kilmarnock, Auchinleck, Cumnock and Dalmellington. They are due to finish in Castle Douglas at 15:30.
Spectators lined the route with the race also being televised.
The Tour of Britain has grown in stature in recent years and now attracts some of the biggest names in the sport.
Olympic medallists Mark Cavendish, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Owain Doull, Elia Viviani, Jack Bobridge, Alex Edmondson, Michael Hepburn and Tom Dumoulin are all among the line-up.
Former world hour record holder Rohan Dennis and German sprinter Andre Greipel, nicknamed The Gorilla, are other high profile riders taking part.
Sports bodies hope that staging major events can also help to create the stars of the future or simply encourage people to get more exercise.
Hours after the Tour of Britain started in Glasgow, the Sky Ride cycling event kicked off in the city.  Thousands of cyclists of all ages took part in the event, which was started by Sir Chris Hoy.
Vicky Strange, head of development at Cycling Scotland, said: ""To have such a big event now coming to Scotland for its first stage is just fantastic.
""The Tour of Britain is one of the biggest events on the calendar - it has really gained in profile.
""So to have the big names coming to Scotland and having these people - household names - right there on your doorstep and we can all get the chance to go and see them up close, I think is hugely inspirational for us.""
Past winners of the Tour of Britain's previous visits to Scotland are:
Large crowds gathered at the start and finish of the race will provide a boost for businesses in the area.
Dumfries and Galloway Council, which has hosted the event on a number of occasions, estimates the visitor expenditure at between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000.
There is also a further boost for accommodation providers with the huge entourage which follows a major cycling race.
Television coverage of the race, which is beamed around the world, is seen as providing a major opportunity to raise the tourist profile of an area.
It has previously been estimated to translate to the equivalent of an advertising campaign costing hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Councils which have helped to host the event will hope it shows off the attractions of the west and south of Scotland to its very best.
Across the opening stage there was a breakaway attempt, and a bunch sprint finish on King Street looks a likely outcome.
If that is the case, there are few sporting scenes more dramatic than a huge group of cyclists hurtling at top speed in their multi-coloured kits.
Rival teams will battle in the final kilometres to try to get their lead-out ""train"" in position to give their best sprinter a chance of victory.
Spectacular crashes are commonplace but, if he emerges unscathed, Mark Cavendish has to be among the favourites to take the win.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Judy finds employment as a secretary at Consolidated Companies. The senior office supervisor, Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), introduces Judy to the company and staff, including mail room clerk Eddie, alcoholic Margaret Foster, the opportunistic boss Franklin Hart, Jr. (Dabney Coleman), and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant. Violet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton). Hart exploits and mistreats his female subordinates, with backstabbing and sexist remarks. He takes credit for Violet's ideas, cruelly yells at and threatens Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction and sexually harasses Doralee, spreading rumors about an affair that never happened. When Violet discovers that a promotion she was hoping to receive was instead given to a man because of sexist hiring practices, she confronts Hart about it, as well as the rumors about Doralee (who enters Hart's office just in time to hear, and now realizes why she has become unpopular with the other secretaries). Violet storms off, stating that she needs a drink. Doralee takes Hart to task over his transgressions, informing him that she keeps a gun in her purse and will ""turn him from a rooster to a hen with one shot"" if his sexist behavior continues. She then also leaves, stating that she needs a drink. Judy, upset over the firing of Maria, a dedicated employee (due to an infraction overheard by Roz, who had been eavesdropping in the ladies' room), joins Violet and Doralee in storming out of the office, and the three women drown their sorrows at the local bar before retiring to Doralee's house to smoke a joint given to Violet by her teenage son.

"Tight, structured clothing and shoes may make you uncomfortable when you travel. They may also increase your risk of developing blood clots. Instead, wear something loose that fits you comfortably. Opt for stretchy pants with an elastic waistline and a loose fitting top, or wear a loose-fitting jersey or cotton dress. Pair your outfit with a pair of comfortable walking shoes, such as sneakers or supportive sandals. You may also want to dress in layers to help keep yourself at a comfortable temperature. For example, you could wear a short-sleeved top with a cardigan or pullover. That way if you feel a chill, you can simply throw on your cardigan. Buckle your seatbelt when you are going to be riding in a car, on a bus, or on an airplane. Make sure that the seatbelt is low around your hips and positioned under your belly. The top strap of a car seatbelt should go across your chest and be positioned above your belly. On an airplane, keep your seatbelt buckled even when the “fasten seatbelt” sign is off. Unexpected turbulence may jostle you around and could even cause injury if you’re out of your seat during severe turbulence. If you will be driving, position yourself as far away from the steering wheel as you can while still being able to fully operate your vehicle. Take some extra time to get adjusted and make sure that your position is both comfortable and safe. If you put your seat all the way back and it is hard for you to reach the steering wheel, you need to be closer to it. Don’t put yourself in unsafe positions just to create more distance between you and the wheel. Gas-producing foods can increase your discomfort while traveling, so it is best to avoid them while you’re in transit. To be extra careful, limit your consumptions of these foods up to 24 hours before you leave too. That helps keep any side-effects caused by last night’s dinner from derailing your morning flight plans.   Steer clear of carbonated beverages, beans, prunes, and any other food or drink that you know will make you gassy. For example, if eating raw vegetables gives you gas, then avoid eating raw vegetables until you reach your destination.

The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides. She wrote of ""her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war"", and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state ""should breathe feelings of generosity, benevolence and religious toleration"". At her behest, a reference threatening the ""undermining of native religions and customs"" was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now.

It is about how the people's lives are connected with and influence each other.The first storyline follows a lawyer named Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) in the early 1800s, whose family is in the slave trade. He has been sent to the Pacific to arrange a contract for some Maori slaves with a slave trader from that area. During his return voyage home, Ewing saves the life of a native man named Autua (David Gyasi) who is a runaway slave stowing away on the ship. Ewing also realizes he is being poisoned by a doctor he trusted, Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks), who is robbing Ewing as he gets sicker and sicker. Autua saves Ewing's life and his views of the natives are changed in important ways as he comes to know the man. Adam Ewing's journal, which chronicled his ordeal and rescue by a runaway slave, are later published into a book which is discovered by the next character in the storyline. Ewing and his wife decide to quit the family slave trade and move east to become abolitionists.The second storyline follows the tragically short life of a talented young wannabe composer in the 1930's named Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) who finagles himself into a position aiding an aging composer, Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). While working for Ayrs, Robert Frobisher begins reading the published chronicle of Adam Ewing's journal which he has found among the many books at Ayrs's mansion. He never finishes reading the journal and it is unclear what effect it has on the creation of his own musical composition. Robert enters a sexual relationship with Ayrs' wife, which, along with Ayrs' own arrogance and presumption of superiority of position and class, tears him and Ayrs apart. Ayrs threatens to ruin Frobisher's already rickety reputation when he encounters Frobisher's own work, the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production ""shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix"". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they ""couldn't top Reign in Blood"", and that whatever they recorded would be ""compared to that album"", he believed they ""had to slow down"", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to ""keep people guessing"" as another reason for the musical shift. ""In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole"", according to Slayer's official biography. ""They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.""King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his ""most lackluster"". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as ""probably the odd man out at that point"", he stated he ""didn't participate as much because of that"".  Hanneman said: ""We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell."" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and ""added too much singing"". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: ""There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else.""Judas Priest's ""Dissident Aggressor"" is the first cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen...  Guess a valid title for it!

"Article: High neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture, it tended to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels.

"Summarize:

After a nervous first-half display, the Republic raised the tempo after the break and Jeff Hendrick's fine run set up Walters's 69th-minute winner.
The Republic stay third in Group D but they have a four-point cushion over Scotland after Germany won in Glasgow.
Poland remain second after routing Gibraltar 8-1 in Warsaw.
The Republic are still four points behind group leaders Germany but, with two matches remaining, they are now in position to clinch at least a play-off spot.
However, those are two tough games as they first host Germany in Dublin on 8 October before concluding their campaign in Poland.
That said, one win would guarantee Martin O'Neill's side one of the eight play-off places.
And a win in Warsaw would clinch an automatic qualifying spot for the Irish if Scotland beat Poland in Glasgow three days earlier.
The one downside from the Republic's win was the bookings picked up by Glenn Whelan and James McClean, which will rule them out of the Germany contest.
Hendrick's stunning run and cross as he jinked past three attempted challenges before setting up Walters to stab home dramatically changed the contest at the Aviva Stadium.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Republic had looked jittery in the first period as Georgia striker Levan Mchedlidze twice went close after being set up by impressive playmaker Tornike Okriashvili.
But boosted by the half-time introduction of Shane Long for the ineffective Robbie Keane, the Republic lifted the pace in the second half as the busy Glenn Whelan and Hendrick tested keeper Nukri Revishvili.
Yet, the Georgians still looked largely comfortable until Hendrick's bit of magic set up Walters's winner.
For that delightful piece of skill alone, the Derby midfielder has to be the man of the match.
Despite lifting the pace after half-time, the Republic were still showing little sign of breaking down the Georgia defence until Hendrick's moment of inspiration.
Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: ""That was very tense. We didn't play well in the first half. We were very tentative. You might even say nervous.
""But in the second half there was a great turnaround, with great effort and application and we found a way to win. Jeff Hendrick was absolutely magnificent for the goal. He has the ability to do that. He just needs a wee bit more encouragement.
""And it was great to see Jon Walters, who has had a fantastic tournament for us, get the goal. He's got a great, great heart.""
Republic of Ireland goalscorer Jon Walters: ""It was all about the result tonight. It was tough but we knew it was going to be that.
""We managed a 1-0 (win) and we couldn't have asked for any more. Fair play to Jeff Hendrick. He made the goal for me. He's got that ability. He's a top quality player.
""We are still a million miles away from qualifying. We've got two big games coming up next months but we'll take that in our stride hopefully.""

"Here is a news article: Media caption Blue Mountains resident: ""I knew my house was gone"" 
  
 Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed. 
  
 The blazes are continuing to burn on the outskirts of Sydney, despite the easing of temperatures and winds. 
  
 One man has died while trying to protect his home. 
  
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott visited Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, one of the areas worst-hit by the fires, around 70km (45 miles) west of Sydney. 
  
 At the scene For families living around the small community of Springwood in the Blue Mountains, many have had their lives turned upside down. Australians are well used to the threat of bush fires, but nothing can prepare you for the moment when you return home to find your house and everything inside utterly gutted by fire. ""It's devastating but we're all here and that's the main thing,"" Chris Muller told me, as her daughter picked through the smouldering rubble of her mother's home. Among the few recognisable things are a couple of silver spoons and a battered coffee pot. ""We're looking for one of my cats Olly. We hope he managed to hide down the drain,"" she tells me. Several fires are still burning around Springwood. Relays of helicopters whirr through the smoky haze, dumping water to try and douse the flames. A drop in the temperature today has given fire fighters a window to try and get on top of the situation before the weekend, when the mercury is expected to rise again. It's only spring here. The fear is of a long and difficult summer fire season. 
  
 Correspondents say bushfires are common in Australia but they have come earlier than normal this year, sparking concerns of further problems to come. 
  
 Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that ""the speed and the ferocity"" of the fires was something ""not seen for many, many years"". 
  
 ""We had one fire front that changed direction and had a front to it, so if you can imagine, burning in one direction 25km [15 miles] wide."" 
  
 ""We're only now in the process of being able to return to some of the sites to check the magnitude of the losses and I've got to say, it's going to be quite substantial,"" he added. 
  
 Hundreds of residents spent Thursday night in evacuation centres, with many returning home to find their houses razed. 
  
 Fire fighters described blazes as tall as 20m to 30m (100ft). 
  
 A 63-year-old man died from a heart attack as he tried to defend his home in Lake Munmorah, in the Central Coast region of NSW, on Thursday afternoon. 
  
 Around 2,000 fire fighters across the state worked to try and contain the fires but many are still burning out of control, says the BBC's Jon Donnison. 
  
 Mr Abbott, in Winmalee, said of those helping to battle the fires: ""These are ordinary people who, on an extraordinary day, come together to support their community and to protect their fellow Australians."" 
  
 At least three fire fighters have been reported injured. 
  
 The NSW Rural Fire Service said an initial assessment of the Winmalee and Springwood areas showed that 81 properties had been destroyed, with 37 damaged. 
  
 Media caption Fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons breaks down as he describes the battle being fought against the bushfires- footage courtesy Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
  
 ""Approximately 30% of the fireground has been assessed,"" it said. ""The number of properties destroyed or damaged will rise."" 
  
 Reports estimate that as many as 200 homes could be lost in total. 
  
 The fires have been caused by unseasonably hot temperatures and strong winds. While these have now died down, more hot weather is forecast next week. 
  
 ""It's been an awful 24 hours for the Blue Mountains [region],"" Mayor Mark Greenhill told Nine Network Television. ""We've lost possibly scores of homes."" 
  
 Ron Fuller, who lost his home in Winmalee, told ABC News: ""We've had a number of fires through here before but this was an extraordinary fire. The speed was extraordinary, it just raced through this whole area, took out some houses, left other ones standing.""

 Jodie Harrison, Mayor of Lake Macquarie, said that four heritage homes, as well as a historic jetty, were caught in the fire. 
  
 ""It's been confirmed that four houses in the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay have been lost,"" she told local media. 
  
 Darkened skyline 
  
 NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell, in an interview on broadcaster 7 News, called the fires ""some of the worst we have experienced around Sydney in living memory"". 
  
 ""We're in for a long, tough summer,"" he added. 
  
 Alex Chesser, a District Officer with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told the BBC that the fires had come unusually early. 
  
 ""It's... a combination of a couple years of quite wet summers and winters which have allowed the bush to continue to grow at high rates, and also prevented us undertaking as many hazard reduction burns as we'd like,"" he said. 
  
 Smoke and ash from the wildfires blanketed the Sydney skyline on Thursday. 
  
 New South Wales was also hit by bush fires in September, which injured several fire fighters.

 (CNN) -- Bush fires blazing in Australia's New South Wales claimed their first victim Friday after a man died of a suspected heart attack defending his home against the blaze on the NSW Central Coast. 
  
 Australian media reports said Walter Lindner, 63, collapsed while battling alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead. He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. 
  
 Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
  
 Authorities say hundreds of homes have been lost with the worst hit areas in the Blue Mountains, a World Heritage area to the west of Sydney, sending thick plumes of smoke into the air. 
  
 Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service. Earlier Thursday, the fire service tweeted that 34 blazes were still out of control. 
  
 More than 100 firefighters were battling flames in Heatherbrae, where one fire has so far destroyed 3,500 hectares (8,649 acres), the service said. 
  
 New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell warned at a news conference Thursday that hundreds of homes could be destroyed by the time the crisis is over. 
  
 He paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency responders battling the flames. 
  
 ""Today's conditions, both the hot, dry conditions but also the wind conditions, have contributed to the difficulties faced by firefighters and communities on the ground,"" he said. 
  
 ""This difficult, damaging and dangerous day and these conditions are not going to be over quickly,"" he said. ""Weather conditions are changing. It will take some days to see the end of these fires, and I suspect if we get through that without the loss of life, we should thank God for miracles."" 
  
 Footage broadcast by CNN affiliate Seven Network showed flames consuming homes. 
  
 The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has issued emergency warnings for the most risky situations. 
  
 They include the State Mine Fire, a large bush fire moving from Lithgow toward Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, which has burned more than 20,000 hectares (more than 49,000 acres) of bushland, firefighters said.

"Write a question about the following article: The Russo-Japanese War and particularly the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 was the first test of the new concepts, resulting in a stunning Japanese victory and the destruction of most Russian ships. With the advent of the steamship, it became possible to create massive gun platforms and to provide them with heavy armor protection. The Dreadnought battleships and their successors were the first capital ships that combined technology and firepower with a mobile platform. However, in the first half of the 20th century, the utility of air power in support of the fleet began to emerge. World War I pitted the old Royal Navy against the new Kaiserliche Marine  of Imperial Germany, culminating in the 1916 Battle of Jutland. The future was heralded when the seaplane carrier HMS Engadine and her Short 184 seaplanes joined the battle. In the Black Sea, Russian seaplanes flying from a fleet of converted carriers interdicted Turkish maritime supply routes, Allied air patrols began to counter German U-Boat activity in Britain's coastal waters, and a British Short 184 carried out the first successful torpedo attack on a ship. In 1918 the Royal Navy converted an Italian liner to create the first aircraft carrier, HMS Argus, and shortly after the war the first purpose-built carrier, HMS Hermes was launched. Many nations agreed to the Washington Naval Treaty and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers while still in the shipyards, but the growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ships. The Yamato-class battleships, the largest ever, displaced 72,000 tons and mounted 18.1-inch  guns.

"Although dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments, concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage) occurred in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as J. C. Flügel's Psychology of Clothes in 1930, and Newburgh's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing in 1949. By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.

"Article: The cardinal protodeacon, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals, has the privilege of announcing a new pope's election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State. In the past, during papal coronations, the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony. However, the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. “Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.” The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino.

They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A woman who was stranded in the rugged Sierra Nevada for nine days while suffering from some broken bones survived by using a water filter to drink from a creek, authorities said. 
  
 Miyuki Harwood, 62, was found Saturday morning in a remote area of the Sierra National Forest after she used a whistle to get the attention of a search and rescue team who were looking for her, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said at a news conference. 
  
 Harwood was airlifted to a hospital to treat an unspecified injury sustained on Aug. 20 when she got separated from a group of hikers near Horsehead Lake, about 100 miles northwest of Fresno. 
  
 She was listed in stable condition, the sheriff said after meeting Harwood at her hospital bed. 
  
 ""Her voice was strong. She was extremely thankful that people were looking for her,"" Mims said. 
  
 Harwood, of Folsom, Calif., was the focus of an intense search involving several law enforcement agencies after she got lost in the mountains. 
  
 She broke some bones and couldn't hike back to her base camp, Mims said. She also had very little food and supplies because she was carrying just enough for a day trip. 
  
 To survive, Harwood crawled for about two days from where she was injured to a creek where she could scoop water into a bottle with a filter inside. 
  
 ""She was a fighter,"" said Rusty Hotchkiss, a California Highway Patrol flight officer and paramedic who flew Harwood to the hospital. 
  
 ""She was very exhausted — very tired, but she was very thankful to be saved and to get out of there,"" he added. 
  
 Mims said the search for Harwood was hampered by thick smoke from a wildfire that has burned 96 square miles nearby in the Kings Canyon National Park. ||||| Facebook

 A 62-year-old woman who vanished while hiking in California was found alive Saturday — more than a week after she was separated from the group she was traveling with, police said. 
  
 Miyuki Harwood was located not far from where she went missing in a remote area of the Sierra National Forest, after hearing rescuers and blowing a whistle to get their attention, said Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. 
  
 Harwood was airlifted to a nearby hospital for treatment of broken bones, Mims said during a news conference Saturday. Mims wouldn't comment on the extent of Harwood's injuries but said she was able to visit with the 62-year-old, who was stable, speaking and ""very grateful that she was found."" 
  
 Harwood was last seen on Aug. 20 near the Courtright Reservoir, about 100 miles east of Fresno, with a hiking group from the Sierra Club, based near Sacramento. She did not know any of the people she was hiking with, but her family told police that she was an experienced hiker, according to the Fresno County Sheriff's Office.

 California Highway Patrol officer Rusty Hotchkiss said the group had only planned a daytrip, and that is all Harwood was prepared for. She had a water filter with her, but ""she had no food,"" Hotchkiss said. 
  
 ""She was a fighter. She was a tough girl,"" Hotchkiss added. ""It just tickles us all to death that we have good news at the end of nine days."" 
  
 ""She was really at the end of the time period that we thought she could survive,"" Mims said. 
  
 Several local agencies, the California Office of Emergency Services and the California National Guard were involved in the aerial and land search for Harwood. More than 60 search and rescue crew members were aided by dogs and drones, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said. 
  
 The search was initially hampered by smoke from a wildfire, called the Rough Fire, which began July 31 and was burning about 10 miles away from the search area. Officials also worried that the smoke would debilitate Harwood as rescuers scrambled to find her. 
  
 Mims warned that hikers should not separate from their groups and stay away from trails with hazardous conditions. ""Especially right now with the fires going on, now is not a good time to go up into that area. Allow the firefighters to do their job,"" Mims said. |||||",0,0,0,1,0,0

Plot title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot. McKaskel removes the bullet, but Vallian runs a high fever and falls on the trail. He is rescued and nursed back to health by Susanna. Eventually, they...

The French side led on two minutes when City's Carli Lloyd handled in the box and Saki Kumagai converted the penalty.
Kosovare Asllani quickly slotted in the hosts' equaliser but Dzsenifer Marozsan soon put Lyon deservedly back in front.
France striker Eugenie Le Sommer added a third after the break to put Lyon in command for the second leg on 29 April.
Champions League debutants City, bidding to be the first English women's team to reach a European final since 2007, almost pulled one back late on but Abbie McManus' effort was palmed onto the woodwork.
The French league champions, who have featured in five of the past seven Champions League finals - winning three - could have won in Manchester by a bigger margin.
Both sides went into the game having kept 13 clean sheets in their past 16 games, yet the match started at a frantic pace, with three goals in the opening 16 minutes.
Lyon had an effort from France captain Wendie Renard cleared off the line even before Japan's Kumagai calmly tucked in from the spot after World Player of the Year Lloyd's handball.
Toni Duggan's fine through ball allowed Sweden's Asllani to level but the visitors were a constant threat and Marozsan quickly drilled in for 2-1 and substitute Le Sommer added further damage from a tight angle in the second half.
Women's FA Cup finalists City - Britain's first Women's Champions League semi-finalists since Birmingham City in 2013-14 - won the English title and League Cup in 2016 and could still theoretically win five trophies in the space of nine months.

"I know that the answer to the question ""What is the long term result of the armistice"" is in ""The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy."".

"Which entity is this text about?

Ross James Brawn OBE (born 23 November 1954) is the Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports and technical director. He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda.

His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel.  Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989.  Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?
It's not that the emperor has no clothes....he's just in his boxers.  Starting off with the truly great - the space.  What an amazing hotel, and a beautiful restaurant.   23rd floor, high ceilings with huge glass panes that provide sweeping views of the Las Vegas strip.  Despite literally having Vegas all around you, from the minute you enter the hotel, you feel like you are being transported someplace else that is quiet, secluded, and exclusive.  I didn't see a single douchebag, or affliction tshirt.  In fact, my ultimate recommendation is to skip the restaurant, and go get a drink in the bar that's on the same floor, and has the same decor and same views.  Everything else - meh.

He recognizes the gravediggers as old friends, and they invite him to a party that night. He takes ecstasy (after refusing cocaine) at the party, but remains detached, and is also impressed by the abundant usage of drugs; indeed, this is the last time he's seen taking any drugs. At home, Andrew had his father book a doctor's appointment for headaches he's been having. During the scene, the father tells a lie but takes it back, and says he does not know why he lied.The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to his doctor's appointment, meeting in the waiting room a girl named Sam, a pathological liar. She will later explain that most times she does not know why she lies, it's like a tic; but still one can trust her to admit her lies. During the scene, she tells him to listen to her music, saying it will change his life, and he does listen and appreciate the song. In Andrew's meeting with his doctor, it's revealed that Andrew has been on lithium, as well as other mood stabilizers and anti-depressants, for his entire adult life, but has stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is also his psychiatrist, put him on the medications in the first place. Andrew finds Sam outside of the office, eventually offering her a ride home. Sam invites him to her house, and he meets her mother. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him, who is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves town.Right after, we see Andrew staring at Mark while he robs a tomb, while another Andrew's friend states that the town is ""so messed up"" because of drug usage, even if he's not exempt from it. This usage is also depicted directly in a number of scenes throughout the movie.Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and...

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil.

"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose piece is now called the Festive Symphony?  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as ""an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince"", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the ""triumphal"" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as ""direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle"". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents ""a cross-section of Czech...

Plot title: The Bone Collector Movie plot: The film begins in late 1999. Tetraplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), team up to solve a string of murders connected to a serial killer by his signature: a single shard of bone removed from each of the victims. Rhyme was paralyzed from the neck down in an earlier accident and is bed-bound and completely reliant on machines and his nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah). The killer poses as a New York City taxi driver and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin that the killer picked up at the airport. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a Civil War-era railroad bed. She also finds a collection of clues including a pile of piece-ground oyster shells, which eventually leads Amelia - now working with Rhyme - to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below-ground services area of a building in the Financial District, secured using old antique handcuffs or shackles at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene. The killer then abducts an NYU student, who is taken to a derelict slaughterhouse where he is tied to a pole. Part of his thigh bone is surgically removed, and he is left for rats to feed on. Amelia and Rhyme, using the clues left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay Rubin's death, find the victim dead. Again, the killer has removed a piece of the victim's bone. Amelia is able to collect the evidence, including another scrap of paper. The pressure of the tense investigation and bureaucratic challenges to both Amelia's and Rhyme's involvement with the case are having serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability. After piecing together the message the killer was sending using the scraps of paper, Amelia and Rhyme are led to an old crime novel, whose crimes...

"Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was designed by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP was designed for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes $95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft, which is later found out to be true and used to later set up Jack with a motive for robbing the bank) and goes out for a drink with colleague Harry Romano and potential employer, Bill Cox. Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home. Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Cox's henchmen. Jack is not told what to do until the next morning, when he is told that he must give Cox $10,000 each from the bank's 10,000 largest depositors ($100 million total). He is outfitted with audio and video devices in the form of a pen and a body microphone, making any intentions to resist useless. Once at work, Cox makes a surprise visit, reintroducing himself as Bill Redmond to Jack's secretary, Janet Stone. Next, Jack gives him a tour of the facilities and security system. On the way back home, Jack attempts to bribe Willy, a henchman, into betraying Cox, yet this only results in Cox killing Willy. The Stanfields attempt an escape, but the plan fails just barely.

"Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that ""Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility"". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, Áed became Hugh, etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more...

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: $11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a $115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

"In May 1409, an uprising in Teutonic-held Samogitia started. Lithuania supported the uprising and the Knights threatened to invade. Poland announced its support for the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, the Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin , captured Bobrowniki after a fourteen-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz , and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel . However, neither side was ready for a full-scale war. Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, agreed to mediate the dispute. A truce was signed on 8 October 1409; it was set to expire on 24 June 1410. Both sides used this time for preparations for the battle, gathering the troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvers. Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom. Wenceslaus, who received a gift of 60,000 florins from the Knights, declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the Knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland. The Knights also paid 300,000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary, who had ambitions for the principality of Moldova, for his military assistance. Sigismund attempted to break the Polish-Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance of such a crown would violate the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and create Polish-Lithuanian discord. At the same time Vytautas managed to obtain a truce from the Livonian Order.

Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death.

In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - Group 11, by modern IUPAC numbering, is a group of chemical elements in the periodic table, consisting of copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au). Roentgenium (Rg) is also placed in this group in the periodic table, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves like the heavier homologue to gold. Group 11 is also known as the ""coinage metals"", due to their former usage. They were most likely the first three elements discovered. Copper, silver, and gold all occur naturally in elemental form.  - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as ""Ekaterinburg"", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia.

"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane. A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that ""they're going to send someone,"" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned.

"An outbreak of measles in 1886 resulted in 113 cases and 8 deaths. Jamestown was lighted for the first time in 1888, the initial cost being borne by the inhabitants. Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, son of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, was exiled at St Helena between 1890 and 1897. Diphtheria broke out in 1887 and also in 1893 which, with an additional outbreak of whooping cough, led to the death of 31 children under 10. In 1890 a great fall of rock killed nine people in Jamestown, a fountain being erected in Main Street in their memory. A census in 1891 showed 4,116 inhabitants lived on the island. A submarine cable en route to Britain from Cape Town was landed in November 1899 and extended to Ascension by December and was operated by the Eastern Telegraph Company. For the next two years over six thousand Boer prisoners were imprisoned at Deadwood and Broadbottom. The population reached its all-time record of 9,850 in 1901. Although a number of prisoners died, being buried at Knollcombes, the islanders and Boers developed a relationship of mutual respect and trust, a few Boers choosing to remain on the island when the war ended in 1902. A severe outbreak of influenza in 1900 led to the death of 3.3% of the population, although it affected neither the Boer prisoners nor the troops guarding them. An outbreak of whooping cough in 1903 infected most children on the island, although only one died as a result.

"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand   with a small notepad   and a hole for a pencil. I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely  the original one. ""I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years."" I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. ""You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?"" My mother replies a little sharply. ""It works perfectly  well. I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days."" Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, ""One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on."" This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics. Those symbols have travelled unaffected through fifty years, rooted in the soil of a cheap wooden breadboard, invisible   exhibits at every meal.

"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is created in Buddhism from modern influence? Context: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.

"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who is vicious towards Louis? from the following article ?  The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled ""sematary"") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is ""sour"". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

"Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

"Answer the following question: Information:  - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal ""intelligent"" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"". As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of ""artificial intelligence"", having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data. Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly.  - Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.  - Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages according to the style of computer programming. Features of various programming languages determine which programming paradigms they belong to; as a result, some languages fall into only one paradigm, while others fall into multiple paradigms. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.  - Carcassonne  is a fortified French town in the Aude department, of which it is the prefecture, in the Region of Occitanie.  - Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that syntactically is a subset of Prolog. It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.  - Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of ""clauses"":  - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department ""Cathar Country"". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste.  - Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. It is based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming. In ASP, search problems are reduced to computing stable models, and ""answer set solvers""  programs for generating stable modelsare used to perform search. The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the DPLL algorithm and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike Prolog query evaluation, which may lead to an infinite loop).  - Alain Colmerauer ( born 24 January 1941 , Carcassonne ) is a French computer scientist and the creator of the logic programming language Prolog .  - Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'field of work' with 'computer science'.

"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: One winter evening, a storekeeper was going to close up his shop. Suddenly he saw Seth, a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow grab a pound of fresh butter and concealed it in his hat. No sooner had the storekeeper seen the act than he hit upon exactly the right revenge. He would punish the thief, and satisfy his own appetite for fun. Seth had his hat on his head, and the butter in his hat. He was anxious to leave. However, the rightful owner of the butter offered him a cup of hot drink, took him by the shoulders and planted him in a seat close to the stove. The grocer stuffed in the stove as many sticks of wood as he could possibly fit inside. Seth already could feel the butter settling down closer to his hair, so he jumped up, declaring that he must go. ""Sit down; don' t be in such a hurry,"" replied the grocer, pushing him back into the chair again. Streak after streak of the butter came pouring from under the poor man's hat. The fun-loving grocer kept on stuffing wood into the stove. Then, as if surprised, he remarked, ""You seem to be perspiring as if you were warm! Let me put your hat away for you."" ""No!"" exclaimed poor Seth at last, unable to stand it a moment longer. ""No, I must go; let me out."" A greasy waterfall of butter was now pouring down the poor man's face and neck, soaking into his clothes, and trickling down his body into his boots. He was bathed in oil from head to toe. Just as his victim darted out the door, the grocer said, ""I reckon the fun I've had out of you is worth the money, so I shan't charge you for that pound of butter in your hat.""

Title: Howard the Duck Movie plot: Twenty-seven-year-old Howard the Duck lives on Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth, but inhabited by anthropomorphic ducks and orbited by twin moons. As he is reading the latest issue of Playduck magazine, his armchair begins to quake violently and propels him out of his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on Earth, in Cleveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs. He defeats them using a unique style of martial arts. After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Because of unfair treatment, Howard quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious. Howard rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager. The two begin to flirt, but soon after that they are interrupted by Blumburtt and two of his colleagues, who reveal that a dimensional-jumping device they were inventing was aimed at Howard's planet and transported him to Earth when it was activated. They theorize that Howard can be sent back to his world through a reversal of this same process. Upon their arrival at the laboratory, the device malfunctions when it is activated, raising the possibility of something else being transported to Earth.

"Some overtures were made by Thailand to establish trade relations with France in 1840 and 1851. In 1856 Napoleon III sent an embassy, led by Charles de Montigny, to King Mongkut. A treaty was signed on 15 August 1856, to facilitate trade, guarantee religious freedom, and grant French warships access to Bangkok. In June 1861, French warships brought a Thai embassy to France, led by Phya Sripipat . In the meantime, France was establishing a foothold in neighbouring Vietnam, putting it on a collision course with Siam. Under the orders of Napoleon III, French gunships under Rigault de Genouilly attacked the port of Da Nang in 1858, causing significant damage, and holding the city for a few months. de Gnouilly sailed south and captured the poorly defended city of Saigon in 1859. From 1859 to 1867, French troops expanded their control over all six provinces on the Mekong delta and formed a French Colony, Cochin China. In 1863, France and King Norodom of Cambodia signed a treaty of protection with France, which transferred the country from Siamese and Vietnamese overlordship to French colonial rule.

When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron). Harry enters the wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart).

"Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee. Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals.

Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States.  Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994.  Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick.  Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season.  In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.

The school offers several international legal programs, operates a variety of clinics, and publishes several law journals., Bernard J. Hibbitts is a Canadian lawyer, professor, and publisher currently teaching in the United States at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Originally trained as a legal historian whose McLuhanistic early work focused on the historical relationship between law, media and the senses, he wrote a series of controversial articles in the mid-1990s on the future of law reviews and scholarly publishing in the then-just-emerging age of the Internet. He is best known today as the founder and publisher of JURIST, the Webby award-winning online legal news service, established in 1996. He is Chairman of the Board of Directors of JURIST Legal News and Research Services, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization., Gaius Trebatius Testa ( fl . 1st century BC ) was a jurist of ancient Rome , whose family , and himself , originated from Elea . He was a protégé of Cicero ; Cicero dedicated his Topica to Trebatius , and recommended Trebatius as a legal advisor to Julius Caesar . Trebatius enjoyed Caesar 's favor , and later that of Augustus as well . Trebatius ' writings included a de religionibus and de iure civili , but not even excerpts of these survive . He was , however , frequently cited by later jurists , and also had a high reputation as the teacher of Marcus Antistius Labeo ., Rome is a city and special ""comune"" (named ""Roma Capitale"") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated ""comune"" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. , JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger. It features continuously updated US and international legal news and expert commentary. JURIST is dedicated to advancing civic education, supporting sound decision-making and promoting the rule of law by objectively reporting, documenting and analyzing important legal developments as they happen. JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community., Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117., Subject: trebatius testa, Relation: date_of_death, Options: (A) 117 (B) 1895 (C) 1996 (D) 2 (E) 20 (F) 4 (G) 50 (H) 501 (I) 60 (J) 870 (K) 90

"Given the background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  and the situation: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.

Toe-riffic news, everyone. 
  
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police say the toe stolen from the Downtown Hotel Sourdough Saloon in Dawson City has been returned to its rightful owner, accompanied by a letter of apology. 
  
 ""We're happy as clams about it,"" said ""toe captain"" Sue Taylor, who had to cut short a phone interview due to a line of customers waiting to drink the saloon's signature Sourtoe Cocktail. 
  
 The dehydrated human toe that disappeared over the weekend is used as a garnish in the famous drink. Its theft temporarily left the hotel with one usable digit. 
  
 Mounties in Dawson City — a town in the Yukon roughly 65 miles east of the Alaska-Canada border — quickly developed a suspect following the theft of the toe on Sunday morning and made efforts to contact him. 
  
 But on Tuesday, the alleged suspect reached out to the Mounties. 
  
 He told them he'd ""placed the toe in the mail, addressed to the Downtown Hotel. The man then called the Downtown Hotel and provided the same message to staff, along with a verbal apology,"" according to a Yukon RCMP release. 
  
 The package arrived Thursday, and Cpl. Jeff Myke went to the saloon to ensure the package was safe to open, according to the Mounties. 
  
 ""Located inside the package was an apology letter, as well as the stolen toe,"" the Mounties said. ""At the time that the package was opened, the toe was believed to be in good condition."" 
  
 Charges aren't expected, according to the Mounties. ||||| June 23 (UPI) -- A thief who stole a mummified toe used in a Canadian hotel's signature cocktail returned the bizarre ingredient and offered an apology. 
  
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Yukon announced the ""sour toe,"" used in the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City's ""sourtoe cocktail,"" had been returned. 
  
 ""On Tuesday afternoon, June 20, Dawson City RCMP received a phone call from the alleged suspect, stating that he had placed the toe in the mail, addressed to the Downtown Hotel,"" police said. ""The man then called the Downtown Hotel and provided the same message to staff, along with a verbal apology."" 
  
 The sour toe was first reported missing on Sunday, when staff at the hotel's Sourdough Saloon said a man from Quebec with a French accent bragged about plans to steal the toe before it disappeared. 
  
 Hotel manager Geri Coulbourn said the bar had back-up toes, but the one that was stolen had been cured in salt for six months after it was recently donated by a man who had it surgically removed. 
  
 Police said the hotel received a package early on Thursday morning and RCMP Cpl. Jeff Myke was present to ensure it was safe to open. 
  
 ""Located inside the package was an apology letter, as well as the stolen toe,"" police said. ""At the time that the package was opened, the toe was believed to be in good condition."" 
  
 No charges are expected to be filed in the case. The hotel's policy states anyone guilty for stealing a sour toe will be fined up to $2,500, but management previously stated the fine would be waived if the toe was returned safely. ||||| A thief who made off with a human toe that is used in a notorious cocktail served by a Dawson City bar has mailed the toe back to its owners, Yukon RCMP say. 
  
 Staff at the Downtown Hotel reported the theft last Sunday, saying someone had made off with one of the bar's mummified toes. The bar, located in a small community more than six hours north of Whitehorse, uses the toes in a drink they call a ""Sourtoe Cocktail."" 
  
 The @SourtoeCocktail's stolen toe was returned: By mail, with a letter of apology says @YukonRCMP: https://t.co/8ive2qhPBi pic.twitter.com/KttIafbI10 — @YukonPhilippe 
  
 The bar apparently has some backup toes, but this one was donated by a man who recently had the toe surgically removed. 
  
 ""This was our new toe, and it was a really good one. We just started using it this weekend,"" hotel manager Geri Coulbourne said after the theft. 
  
 The local RCMP detachment got a call on Tuesday from the man suspected of taking the toe, saying he had put the pilfered digit in the mail. 
  
 ""The man then called the Downtown Hotel and provided the same message to staff, along with a verbal apology."" 
  
 An RCMP officer was on hand to open the package, which contained both the toe and a letter of apology. 
  
 ""At the time that the package was opened, the toe was believed to be in good condition,"" the RCMP release said. 
  
 No charges are expected, police say. |||||Summary:

Don and Alice are happy that their two children are on a school trip to Spain and thus away from the disaster. They allow a young boy to enter the house but the infected have followed him and break in. The others are killed. Don abandons Alice to save himself.Twenty eight weeks later, the infected have all starved to death. An American-led NATO force has secured parts of London and is now allowing the return of English citizens who had been abroad during the outbreak.

An Army medical officer, Scarlet (Rose Byrne), discovers an old bite wound on her and does a blood test. Alice has the rage virus teeming in her blood but is immune to its effects. However she is a carrier who could infect others with her saliva or blood. The commanding officer, Stone (Idris Elba), orders Alice executed even though she could hold the secret to curing the virus. Meanwhile, Don sneaks into where Alice is being kept. Tammy and Andy had bitterly accused him of abandoning her and he wants to explain himself. She tells him she loves him. They kiss tenderly and Don is infected with the virus. Becoming an enraged madman, he crushes Alice's skull and... My question: Whom does the abondoned helicopter belong to?

It stretches from the Pacific Ocean at State Route 1 (SR 1) (Pacific Coast Highway) in Santa Monica, California, to I-95 in Jacksonville, Florida. This freeway is part of the originally planned Interstate Highway network that was laid out in 1956, and its last section was completed in 1990. I-10 is the fourth-longest Interstate Highway in the United States, following I-90, I-80, and I-40. About one-third of its length is within the state of Texas, where the freeway spans the state at its widest breadth.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, Interstate Freeway System, Interstate System, or simply the Interstate) is a network of controlled-access highways that forms a part of the National Highway System of the United States. The system is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed its formation. Construction was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the original portion was completed 35 years later, although some urban routes were cancelled and never built. The network has since been extended and, , it had a total length of . , about one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country use the Interstate system. In 2006, the cost of construction was estimated at about $425 billion (equivalent to $ in ).  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Florida (Spanish for ""land of flowers"") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba.

( formerly Clear Channel Communications until September 2014 ) . Its studios are located on Interstate 10 in Northwest San Antonio near Balcones Heights , TX , and the transmitter site is in unincorporated Bexar County near Government Canyon .  - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations ""AC"" and ""DC"" are often used to mean simply ""alternating"" and ""direct"", as when they modify ""current"" or ""voltage"".  - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS).  - Jacksonville is a seaport city and the seat of Duval County, Florida, United States.

"By. Ian Sparks. French film star Gerard Depardieu has sparked fresh outrage in France by defending Vladimir Putin's clampdown on his opponents and declaring: 'The masses are stupid.' The actor - who recently became a French tax exile and was given a Russian passport - also defended sending the three members of Pussy Riot to a Russian labour camp. And in an extraordinary comparison, he said the trio - who staged an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow church - would have been 'executed' if they had done the same thing in a mosque. Controversial: Gerard Depardieu has spoken out to defend Vladimir Putin's Russian regime. France's Metro newspaper today branded the Gallic screen legend 'a spokesman for the Kremlin'. The 64-year-old actor spoke out on state-run TV Channel Russia 24 at the weekend, when he attacked the millions who accused the Russian president of rigging last year's parliamentary election. Depardieu - who has been offered the post of culture minister of the Russian republic of Mordovia - told viewers: 'The Russian opposition has no programme. It has nothing. 'Unfortunately, the masses are stupid. Only the individual is beautiful.' Depardieu said the opposition had some 'very smart people' such as former chess champion Garry Kasparov in its ranks. But he added: 'That is good for chess, and not much else.' Allies: Putin arranged for the French actor to be granted Russian citizenship earlier this month. Passport: Depardieu is leaving France in protest at the country's 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires. And he said of Pussy Riot, the all-female punk band who performed in Moscow's main cathedral last year: 'Imagine if these ladies walked into a mosque - they would not have come out alive. 'But when I say such things in France, I am considered an idiot. I know lots of Russians who lived in France, but have now returned to their homeland because they missed the human warmth they find there.' Former French minister and now MEP Corinne Lepage said of the actor: 'If Gerald Depardieu wants to be culture minister in a republic that still has prison labour camps and make a ""man-sandwich"" with Vladimir Putin, that's his business.' The Cyrano de Bergerac star is among flood of wealthy French people to have come under attack for quitting the country over plans for a new top tax rate of 75 per cent on earnings over â‚¬1million. Electronic music icon Jean-Michel Jarre and tycoon optician Alain Afflelou are both moving to Britain, while France's richest man Bernard Arnault has tried and failed to get Belgian nationality. Pals: Depardieu with outspoken FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich last week. New home: The actor's face on an ad on the side of a bus in St Petersburg. Depardieu was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' by French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault after announcing last month that he was moving abroad. But the furious star hit back with an open letter to Mr Ayrault in Le Journal du Dimanche, storming: 'I don't ask to be approved of, but I could at least be respected! 'All those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been.' Depardieu said he had always paid his taxes and asked the prime minister: 'Who are you to judge me in this way? 'I also give you back my passport and my social security that I have never used.' Jailed: Pussy Riot were sent to a labour camp after staging a protest in a Moscow cathedral. Paris estate agents have also said France's luxury property market has hit a 'selling panic' as the super-rich flee to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain and Switzerland. Daniel Feau said: 'Some 400 to 500 residences worth more than â‚¬1million have come onto the Paris market since May. It's nearly a general panic.' And British estate agent Knight Frank said the socialist's tax plans had sent French interest in luxury London homes rocketing. David Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to wealthy French wanted to relocate to the UK. He added: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.' The comments left French MP Claude Bartolone so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them.

"Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In face of global warming, much effort has been focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of strategies. But while much of the research and innovation has concentrated on finding less-polluting energy alternatives, it may be decades before clean technologies like wind and solar meet a significant portion of our energy needs. In the meantime, the amount of CO2 in the air is rapidly approaching the limits proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). ""As long as we're consuming fossil fuels, we're putting out CO2,"" says Klaus Lackner, a geophysicist at Columbia University, ""We cannot let the CO2 in the atmosphere rise indefinitely."" That sense of urgency has increased interest in capturing and storing CO2, which the IPCC says could provide the more than 50% reduction in emissions needed to reduce global warming. ""We see the potential for capture and storage to play an integral   role in reducing emissions,"" says Kim Corley, Shell's senior advisor of CO2 and environmental affairs. That forward thinking strategy is gaining support. The U.S. Department of Energy recently proposed putting $1 billion into a new $2.4 billion coal-burning energy plant. The plant's carbon-capture technologies would serve as a pilot project for other new coal-burning plants. But what do you do with the gas once you've captured it? One option is to put it to new uses. Dakota Gasification of North Dakota captures CO2 at a plant that converts   coal into synthetic natural gas. It then ships the gas 200 miles by pipeline to Canada, where it is pumped underground in oil recovery operations. In the Netherlands, Shell delivers CO2 to farmers who pipe it into their greenhouses, increasing their production of fruits and vegetables. However, scientists say that the scale of CO2 emissions will require vast amounts of long-term storage. Some propose storing the CO2 in coal mines or liquid storage in the ocean, Shell favors storing CO2 in deep geological structures such as saline   formations and exhausted... Question: What does the author intend to tell readers? - How to find more oil and natural gases. - How to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. - How to deal with the greenhouse gas creatively. - How to make good use of solar and wind energy.

The wetter your toy, the longer it will take to dry. Make sure all the excess water is gone before drying your animal on a clothesline. On a sunny day, use clothespins to hang your toy and set it to dry. The sun is a natural stain remover and sanitizer. Spot cleaning doesn’t require a lot of water, so you probably won’t need to hang out an animal that has been spot cleaned. Let your stuffed animal air dry if the weather isn’t cooperating. Simply let it sit in a protected area, away from pets and children. If your label indicates that you are able to use a dryer, place your animal in a dryer on low heat or permanent press. You may also use a hair dryer on a low setting or on cool. While heat dries the animal quickly, it can also damage the animal or mat the fur. If your dryer has a fluff air setting, use this to help maintain the fur. Add towels into your load to soften the movements of your animal. Also use dryer sheets to eliminate static electricity buildup so your little one doesn’t get shocked when first holding it. The inside takes longer than the outside to dry.

 A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.)
 Here are the list of step templates and their description:
 Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]
 Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]
 Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]
 Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].
 Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]
 Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]
 Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number] 
 Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]
 Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]
 Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]
 Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]
 Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]
 Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2].

What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1966, numerous pirate radio stations broadcast to the United Kingdom from ships anchored in international waters, specialising in rock and pop music that is not played on BBC Radio. Seventeen-year-old Carl (Tom Sturridge), recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the station ""Radio Rock"" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by the brash American DJ ""The Count"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), quickly accept Carl as one of their own. At the start of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns off the lights and goes into the bathroom, where has has Carl hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count, who was initially brought to Radio Rock as Gavin's replacement.

Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia.  Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution.  Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1. The following day, the 59 delegates created the Republic of Texas by affixing their signatures to the Texas Declaration of Independence. Houston's military authority was expanded on March 4, to include ""the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.""

Question: After the Carmichael mansion was left in ruins from fire, what item opens and begins playing a lullaby? Movie title: The Changeling Movie plot: John Russell (George C. Scott), a composer living in New York, New York, moves cross-country to Washington state following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York. In suburban Seattle, John rents a large, old and eerie Victorian-era mansion and begins piecing his life back together. However, John soon discovers that he has unexpected and unwelcome company in his new home: the unhappy ghost of a murdered young boy. The ghost makes its presence felt by various phenomena such as shattering windows, abruptly opening and shutting doors, and manifesting itself dramatically during a seance. John investigates the identity of the dead child and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful local family, the heir of which is a wealthy United States senator, Joseph Carmichael. John subsequently discovers that the real Joseph Carmichael (who was born in 1900) was murdered in 1906 by his father, Richard. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which in 1905, he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, and took the orphan to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure. He returned several years later with the impostor, now grown and ""cured"" of his illness, and continued as if nothing had happened. Now, the ghost of the real Joseph haunts the house, making great efforts to persuade John to investigate his murder, and give him some form of justice. John's investigation leads him to a property that was once owned by the Carmichael family, and after convincing Mrs. Gray (the owner of the property and whose daughter has seen Joseph's ghost), John discovers the skeletal remains of Joseph in a well underneath the house, as well as his birth medal. After taking the medal without handing it over to the police, John attempts...

"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie opens several months after the events in the first Iron Man movie. We are introduced to a man named Ivan Vanko. Ivan's father Anton is slowly dying and telling Ivan his final wishes. Ivan thinks he should have the fame that Tony Stark is enjoying but Anton tells him to ""ignore that garbage."" All Anton can give Ivan is his knowledge. Ivan takes a blueprint that has his father's name on it, and also the name of Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father. Ivan then sets about recreating the Arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the ""Stark Expo"" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony's new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony's usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon.

"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as ""pointless,"" and said ""participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'"" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Options:  A. not enough information  B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US.  C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.  D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control.

The well-to-do family must move to the ""countryside"" when the father is promoted (to Obersturmbannführer). Unknown to Bruno, the new house is near a Nazi concentration camp, and Ralf is the new commandant. Bruno initially dislikes the new house as he always has to stay in the house or the garden; also there are no other children to play with, apart from his sister. From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a barbed wire fence with people in ""striped pyjamas"" behind it. Though he thinks it is a farm, it is the camp with Jewish people in their camp clothing. Bruno is forbidden to go there, because according to Ralf, ""they're not really people""; it is agreed that at least they are a bit weird, as demonstrated by their clothing.Bruno goes there anyway, secretly, and becomes friends with a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), whom he meets at the fence, and who is the same age. Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew and that the Jewish people have been imprisoned here by soldiers, who also took their clothes and gave them the striped camp clothing, and that he is hungry. Bruno is confused and starts having doubts about his father being a good person. Later, he is relieved after seeing a propaganda film about the camp (that is a parody of Theresienstadt). Bruno often returns to the fence. He brings Shmuel food and plays draughts (checkers) with him through the fence.An elderly Jewish man named Pavel (David Hayman) is a servant in the family home; he is treated rudely by Ralf's adjutant, Obersturmführer Kotler (Rupert Friend).

The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane, later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super-baby named Kahuna who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives. The film starts with a group of babies in a day care centre. Archie tells the others (Finkelman, Alex, and Rosita) a story about a super baby called Kahuna. Kahuna rescues kids all around the world. According to Archie, Kahuna rescued a group of children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. Kahuna and Kane are nemeses and hate each other, but Kahuna always wins their battles. Archie's father Stan, who seems to own the day care centre, is letting it be used as a television set by the evil Biscane (yes, in other words, Kane) who is starting up his own TV channel.

Newly relocated in the Scottish town of Greenock, Lizzie accepts a job at the local fish and chips shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school. Through a Glasgow post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a merchant seaman working on the HMS Accra. In reality, the letters he receives are written by his mother, who prefers maintaining this charade instead of telling the boy the reason she fled her marriage. When she learns that the Accra will soon be arriving at the docks at Greenock, Lizzie in a panic concocts a scheme to hire a man to impersonate Davey. When her effort to find someone at the local pub fails, she enlists Marie's assistance. Marie arranges for her to meet an acquaintance who coincidentally is passing through town at the same time the Accra will be in port. When Lizzie and the stranger (Gerard Butler) meet, he doesn't tell her his name. Lizzie explains the situation and gives him the letters to provide some background.

"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: When the Japanese attacked America's ships at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, they did it secretly. The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently. The noise about Pearl Harbor, made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere   before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. As Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of ""changing"" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie. It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing, as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War. Japan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities  . And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan, where it has a theme park. Not all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise. A reviewer for Newsweek, who was given an early preview, acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence   showing the attack itself was powerful. The attack comes quite late in the movie, however, and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story. ""Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie, "" the reviewer wrote. Question: From the passage we know that Ben Affleck_.

Review: This book is a biography of Franz Kafka. Throughout the book we get summaries of Kafka's important works and we get to see Crumb's visual interpretation of these stories. That is the best part of the book for me. The biographical side is also very good, explaining a bit of why Kafka wrote like that.While reading the book, I felt like it is hard to call most of it a comic book, because it has a lot of prose. The parts of the book where we get to see Crumb interpret Kafka's stories definitely feel like a comic book, but the biography section doesn't. However, I thinks this works very well in the book, it makes the stories more alive when the images tell more than just being a drawing.I enjoyed the book, it is worth reading. Answer:

"Q:Q: The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the ______ period.   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits acetycholinesterase. What effect would Sarin have on muscle contraction? After depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which voltagegated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane sodium–potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+ back into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.   Choices:  - activation  - extraction  - interstitial  - refractory   A:

"Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a $16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food $2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, ""In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off."" Question: This passage is mainly about   _  . - different kinds of tipping in different countries - the relationship between tipping and custom - the origin and present meaning of tipping - most American people hate tipping

When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes   I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys  . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine  . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around   with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating   and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant   that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. ""Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys.

"So what next for Jones and his side as they try and hunt down the world champions?
Head coach Eddie Jones captured the mood of an excited nation after England completed an historic 3-0 whitewash in Australia, just months after sealing a first Grand Slam in 13 years.
""I'm sure that everyone at home who watched the three Tests can't wait to see us play in November,"" the Australian said. ""They must be lining up at Twickenham now trying to get seats.""
Next up for England are the autumn Tests against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia.
Jones says England were too inconsistent across the series, best illustrated by the lax defensive displays in the first and third Test matches. Defence coach Paul Gustard will be tasked with ensuring the heroic rearguard effort in the second Test in Melbourne was not a one-off.
""We've got a lot of hard work ahead of us,"" Jones told BBC Sport after Saturday's 44-40 victory in Sydney. ""We have serious deficiencies in our consistency, but that will come with time and with more detailed practice.
""The All Blacks beat Wales by a big score, which just shows their incredible relentlessness. We don't have that yet but that's where we are aiming to go.""
Jones will be aware that the Wallabies were hampered in the series by injury and unavailability, and the players acknowledge there is plenty to work on.
""We are not the finished article by any means,"" said scrum-half Ben Youngs. ""We have got to kick on from where we are.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Before the Six Nations, Jones said England lacked ""world-class players"", so have any of his charges elevated themselves to that level since then?
""[Number eight] Billy Vunipola was absolutely outstanding, while his brother Mako really came through on this tour,"" Jones said.
""I thought Owen [Farrell] and George [Ford] really grew as guys who could control a game, they knew when to run, knew when to kick, and knew when to pass. So they are the guys that really stood out.""
Jones also had special praise for prop Dan Cole, who has been another key performer for England after a difficult World Cup, while flankers James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were also outstanding and lock Maro Itoje has continued his staggering development.
Farrell scored an astonishing 66 points in the series, nailing 23 out of his 26 kicks at goal in the process.
At the start of the season the debate was whether  Farrell or Ford should play at fly-half; this tour has shown that there must be a place for Farrell in the starting XV, regardless of the number on his back.
The Saracen has been compared to all-time great Jonny Wilkinson by the Australian media because of his relentless accuracy from the tee and, if he stays fit, chasing down Wilkinson's England points record is not unfeasible.
But while Jones has spoken in the past of his desire for a big ball-carrier at inside-centre - Luther Burrell started the series in Brisbane - it will now be hard to break up the Ford and Farrell combination at 10 and 12, with both players excelling down under.
The two could become ""legends of the game"" according to skills coach Glen Ella, and it would be a surprise if they both don't start in the autumn.
However, Jones will have options in the midfield: Manu Tuilagi will be drafted back into the squad if he can finally avoid injury, while Northampton's Harry Mallinder caught the eye as he led the England to the World Rugby Under 20 Championship at the weekend.
Then there is Ben Te'o, who didn't feature in the tour down under, but will be playing in the Premiership next season with Worcester.
While urging his players to improve, Jones is looking to do likewise, and will spend time with the Orica GreenEDGE team at next month's Tour de France in the belief he must develop as a coach if England are to the top the world rankings.
""I'm keen to have a look at what they do because I've got to get better,"" he said. ""If the team's not consistent, then our coaching's not good enough. You can never take your foot off the pedal.""
England don't play New Zealand until 2017 at the earliest, and while supporters would love to see the side's resurgence tested against the best in the world, the schedule does present England with a genuine chance of going through 2016 unbeaten.
South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia visit Twickenham in the autumn, with all four matches eminently winnable. It may be that England have won 12 from 12 ahead of a rematch with the Wallabies on the first weekend of December.
""Absolutely, there's no reason we can't [win every match],"" said Youngs. ""But there is a lot of rugby to be played between now and then. It's an exciting time for England rugby, and I feel very privileged to have been a part of this tour party.""
""English rugby is in a good place,"" reflected captain Dylan Hartley. ""We were in a dark place maybe six months ago, and I hope we have now given the people something to cheer about.""

It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. 2. Drink clean water. 3. Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.

"Article:
Clocks are one of the enabling technologies of the modern world. Without highly accurate clocks, the global positioning system would not function correctly, neither would it be possible to synchronise networks over vast distances. And physicists rely on clocks to test the fundamental laws of the universe to ever deeper levels. 
  
 So having more accurate and reliable clocks is an important goal. 
  
 Today, Andrew Ludlow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder and a few buddies unveil the two most accurate clocks ever built. They say their new clocks can keep time with an unprecedented precision of one part in 10-18. 
  
 Ludlow and co put this in perspective: “A measurement at the 1018 fractional level is equivalent to specifying the age of the known universe to a precision of less than one second or Earth’s diameter to less than the width of an atom.” 
  
 Their clock is a simple beast, at least in principle. The basic idea is that a second can be defined by the frequency of light emitted by an atom when electrons in the ground state jump to another state. 
  
 The difficulty is measuring this frequency accurately. That’s because any small movement of the atom generates a Doppler effect that shifts the frequency. What’s more, stray electric fields can shift these electronic transitions, changing their frequency, a phenomenon known as a Stark shift. Overcoming these small sources of error is the major challenge in building accurate clocks. 
  
 Ludlow and pals have done it using a technology known as an optical lattice clock. In this approach, they bounce a laser off a mirror to create a standing wave of light which forms a lattice to trap atoms. This is a kind of eggbox in which the atoms sit. 
  
 They then fill this eggbox with ytterbium atoms and zap them with another laser to see the frequency at which the electronic transition occurs. 
  
 The eggbox is important because it holds the atoms in a vice-like grip that minimises any Doppler effects. 
  
 However, electric fields associated with the light generate a Stark shift. The team get around this by choosing a so-called “magic” transition in ytterbium in which both electronic states are shifted by the same amount, leaving the transition frequency unchanged. 
  
 And because the eggbox can be filled with many atoms, Ludlow and co-can make their measurements using many atoms so that get a clearer signal. 
  
 The result is a clock that loses only one “tick” in 1018 “tocks”. 
  
 Of course, there’s no way to measure the accuracy of a single clock, which is why these guys have two. 
  
 The new clocks immediately make possible a number of new and important applications. These clocks are so sensitive that they can easily measure the gravitational redshift, in which clocks tick more slowly in more powerful gravitational fields. In other words they can sense changes in height. 
  
 The best clocks today are sensitive to changes of many metres or kilometres. The new clock should be able to discern changes of around 1 cm at the Earth’s surface. That will be for applications such as hydrology, geology and the measurement of ice pack changes in climate change studies. 
  
 It would also physicists to test whether things like gravitational red shift and the fine structure constant change with position, important fundamental tests of physics. 
  
 The improvement of clocks is an ongoing process that humanity has undertaken over several thousand years. These latest timepieces are the impressive culmination of all this work and yet they are bound to be eclipsed in the not too distant future. 
  
 Indeed Ludlow and co point to various improvements that they had to make in the near future to make their clock even better. And when they do the next clocks will be even better. Such is the nature of technology. 
  
 Ref: http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5869 : An Atomic Clock With 10-18 Instability ||||| If the watch on your wrist ran slow by five minutes over the course of a year, you probably wouldn’t think anything of it. But scientists and engineers rely on ultra-accurate atomic clocks for a range of applications, and the quest for ever-more-accurate clocks has gone on for millennia. 
  
 Now, a group of researchers led by Andrew Ludlow of the National Institute of Standards and Technology has set the bar higher than ever. Their newest atomic clock, unveiled yesterday, is predicted to become inaccurate by an amount of 1.6 seconds of time after running for a total of 1018 seconds—or, in other words, it loses one full second over the course of about 50.8 billion years. 
  
 In the paper describing their clock, the researchers provided a pair of analogies for this level of accuracy: “ is equivalent to specifying the age of the known universe to a precision of less than one second,” they wrote, “or Earth’s diameter to less than the width of an atom.” 
  
 Like all clocks, atomic clocks keep consistent time by basing the duration of a second off a physical event that happens with regularity. While mechanical clocks use the swinging of a pendulum to maintain time, atomic clocks use a mechanism that occurs with even more regularity: the specific frequency of light needed to cause an atom to fluctuate between two energy states (specifically, to go from a ground state into an excited state), which is always a uniform value. For example, the current international standard that defines the duration of a second is 9,192,631,770 cycles of the amount of microwave radiation that causes cesium atoms to fluctuate between the two energy states and in the process emit the most light possible. 
  
 A few factors, though, can distort even the most careful measurements of this frequency. What the researchers behind this new clock have done is create an innovative design (using a different element) that minimizes these distortions more than any clock before. 
  
 Their design, called an “optical lattice clock,” traps ytterbium atoms inside a lattice box of laser beams. Held in place, the atoms are bombarded by a second type of laser, which forces their electrons to jump up in energy level. A sensor checks to make sure that all the atoms reach the higher energy level, and the precise light frequency needed to force them to do so is then converted into the exact length of a second. 
  
 Normally, any slight physical movement of the atoms as they’re bombarded can lead to subtle changes in the frequency of light needed to raise their energy level (a result of Doppler shift), throwing off the accuracy of the clock. But, as described in the MIT Technology Review, where news of the clock was first published, the box of laser beams “holds the atoms in a vice-like grip that minimises any Doppler effects.” Additionally, the lattice traps a relatively large number of atoms (between 1,000 and 1,000,000) compared to most atomic clocks, so averaging the amount of radiation needed to raise each of these to the higher energy level provides a more accurate value of the radiation’s precise frequency, which is then used to set time. 
  
 Comparing two such clocks together, the authors found something remarkable–each “tick” measures intervals of time so perfectly that one clock will only lag behind the true time by a tenth of a second when our Sun envelopes the Earth as it evolves into a red giant about 5 billion years from now. 
  
 This new clock—and the gradual refinement of atomic clocks as a whole—might seem like a purely academic pursuit, but in reality there are a ton of very useful applications of the technology. Take, for instance, the “maps” app on your phone. Without the ability to closely synchronize clocks over great distances, the GPS system wouldn’t be able to work, because it relies upon the exact comparison of the time it takes signals to travel from several different satellites to your GPS-enabled device. 
  
 Future pursuits that could use this newest advance in atomic clock technology could fall within the science of geodesy, which seeks to precisely measure tiny changes in Earth’s shape and its gravitational field over time. All clocks tick at infinitesimally slower rates at sea level than at a mile high, because the force of gravity is stronger when closer to the Earth. Currently, with the most sophisticated atomic clocks, this difference in speed can only be measured when elevation changes by thousands of feet, but with the new clock, they will be detectable when the clock is raised or lowered by a mere centimeter, making the system potentially useful for measuring slight changes in glacier ice thickness or elevation gained by mountain ranges over time as tectonic plates collide. |||||Summary:",0,0,0,1,0,0

The album itself seemed far more adventurous in sound, with short instrumental interludes included between songs and far more experimentation with keyboards and bass.  - The Prize Recruit is the debut full-length album from Australian nu metal band, Superheist. It was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne by Superheist and producer Kalju Tonuma and released on 15 April 2001. It peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 Tonuma was nominated for Producer of the Year and Engineer of the Year for the album.  - The Yarra Valley is the name given to the region surrounding the Yarra River in Victoria, Australia. The river originates approximately 90 kilometres east of the Melbourne central business district and flows towards it and out into Port Phillip Bay. The name Yarra Valley is used in reference to the upper regions surrounding the Yarra River and generally does not encompass the lower regions including the city and suburban areas, where the topography flattens out, or the upper reaches which are in inaccessible bushland. Included in the Yarra Valley is the sub-region of Upper Yarra (or the Upper Yarra Valley) which encompasses the towns of the former Shire of Upper Yarra in the catchment area upstream of and including Woori Yallock. The Yarra Valley is a popular day-trip and tourist area, featuring a range of natural features and agricultural produce, as well as the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail.  - The Mornington Peninsula is a peninsula located south-east of Melbourne, Australia. It is surrounded by Port Phillip to the west, Western Port to the east and Bass Strait to the south, and is connected to the mainland in the north. Geographically, the peninsula begins its protrusion from the mainland in the area between Pearcedale and Frankston. The area was originally home to the ""Mayone-bulluk"" and ""Boonwurrung-Balluk"" clans and formed part of the Boonwurrung nation's territory prior to European settlement.  - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (""usually a municipality"") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term ""unité urbaine"", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an ""agglomeration"", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.  - Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia. The name ""Melbourne"" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians.  - Port Phillip (also commonly referred to as Port Phillip Bay or (locally) just The Bay), is a large bay in southern Victoria, Australia; it is the location of Melbourne. Geographically, the bay covers and the shore stretches roughly . Although it is extremely shallow for its size, most of the bay is navigable.

"Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow.

"Answer based on context:

Regent Moray and his secretary John Wood tried to gain English support by producing the Casket letters in England, which were intended to incriminate Mary in the death of Lord Darnley. Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled ""Captain General."" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital.

""Honestamente pienso que Trinidad debía haber pensado mucho mejor la decisión de renunciar al título wélter sin antes no haber hecho una segunda pelea contra De La Hoya"", valoró Arum.

"By. Anna Edwards. Imomotimi Wilson treated his alleged victim 'like a piece of meat' A man on trial for rape for allegedly refusing to wear a condom on the third time he had sex with a woman in a one-night stand has told the jury it was 100 per cent consensual. Imomotimi Wilson, 30, met his alleged victim in a pub and she agreed to go back to his house but told him she would only have sex if he used protection. They had consensual sex twice but on the third occasion claims that Wilson failed to use a condom. The woman, a 40-year-old, said Wilson treated her 'like a piece of meat' as the alleged attack took place. She said he held her hands over her head and told her 'if you love me you'll do it' before raping her for 15-20 seconds. But giving evidence at his trial at Cambridge Crown Court Wilson said 'she said stop and that's when I stopped'. He said: 'She said I feel like having sex again and I said ""Yes, I feel like having sex with you as well again but there is no condom"". 'She was romancing me, touching and kissing, and I said no, I do not want to do that because there is no condom. 'She started kissing me again and then I penetrated her. I believed 100 per cent it was consensual. 'Then she said stop and that's when I stopped. There were three seconds of penetration.' The court heard how the pair met at The Regal pub in Cambridge on June 9 last year. The court heard how she phoned police later that afternoon and Wilson was arrested. The court heard how the pair met at The Regal pub in Cambridge on June 9 last year and took a taxi back to Wilson's shared house in the city at 2am. She then spent most of the evening in bed with the defendant before leaving the property at around 6am. The court heard how she phoned police later that afternoon and Wilson was arrested. Caroline Allison, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution say that she had made it perfectly clear in plain straight-forward language that the situation was no condom, no sex and that nothing had happened in the intervening period that would invite a reasonable belief that she was indeed consenting to unprotected sex.' Wilson, of Cambridge, has pleaded not guilty to rape after claiming he stopped on the third time the woman said no. The trial continues.

Hammer et al. found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Certain plants and animals can survive under what seem like impossible conditions. Blind fish live freely under ocean depths that are  ly dark and cold. Bacteria live at temperatures of 600 degF or a higher in places where the heat comes from the deep earth. One of the most remarkable achievements that we can observe directly is the ability of the plants and animals in the desert. In the Death Valley ,temperatures of 134 degF in the shade have been officially reported Yet lizards live there ,along with 600 species of plants, 30 species of mammals? and even fish. While the days are terribly hot, the nights are extremely cold. Temperatures can fall down by as much as 50 degF. Plants called xerophytes are perfectly adapted to the extremely dry conditions. These plants have survived by developing techniques for coping with their environment. Like all living things ,they must have water ,and they get it in several ways. The mesquite and the prickly  pear pick up moisture in opposite ways. The mesquite sends its roots down as deep as 60 feet to tap the water table. The prickly pear, on the other hand ,spreads its roots wide. These roots are shallow but they pick up whatever moisture is available at ground level. The paloverde saves water by shedding leaves in times of extreme drought The barrel cactus makes sure of a water supply by storing water in the plant itself. The saguaro cactus stores so much water that it can survive years of drought. But even the saguaro will die sooner or later if there is no rain. All these plants ,although well adjusted to their environment, must eventually get water. Even if the parent plants die, there are always seeds to keep the species alive. Since the desert is so tough, thousands of seeds must be released to produce one plant. To get rooted, these seeds must have exactly the right conditions. They can lie dormant for months, even years, until a little water stimulates the sparks of life. 
 Answer: Plants and animals can survive in the desert by adjusting to the environment.

"Please answer the following question: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. ""Jerusalem,"" he mumbled. ""Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters."" Then he panted heavily. ""Hush, sire,"" she whispered. ""Rest easy.""

By. Anna Hodgekiss. It has long been said it's possible to die from a broken heart - and now scientists say the phenomenon can also be triggered by the shock of natural disasters. They have discovered the stress of hurricanes and earthquakes can trigger a condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Also known as broken heart syndrome, this is where the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened. Scientists have discovered that natural disasters such as tornadoes (the aftermath of the one that hit Joplin, Missouri, is pictured) can trigger a condition called broken heart syndrome. Researchers found that disaster areas such as Joplin - where this tornado struck in 2011 - had higher rates of the potentially fatal condition that year. It is often triggered. by extreme physical or emotional stress – for example, being in a car. accident or losing a child or spouse, say the U.S. researchers. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy got its name because the abnormal shape of. the heart resembles a Japanese octopus fishing pot (tako=octopus,. tsubo=pot). Previous research has linked broken heart syndrome to natural disasters, including. the 2004 earthquake in Japan. Now, scientists at the University of Arkansas have studied catastrophies in the U.S. They found dramatic spikes in cases of broken heart syndrome in two states after major natural disasters, suggesting the stress of disasters as a likely trigger. They identified 21,748 patients diagnosed with cases of broken heart syndrome in 2011 using a nationwide hospital discharge database. After mapping the cases by state, Vermont and Missouri emerged as having the highest rate of cases, with 380 cases per million residents in Vermont and 169 per million in Missouri. A distraught woman in Banda Aceh after the Asian tsunami in 2004. Researches say broken heart syndrome is triggered by stress and causes the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened. Most states had fewer than 150 cases per million residents. New Hampshire and Hawaii had the lowest rate of the disease that year. The rate of broken heart cases in Vermont in 2011 was more than double most other states. This was the same year that Tropical Storm Irene pummeled the state with heavy rain and wind, causing the most devastation Vermont has experienced since the Great Flood of 1927. Similarly, researchers found broken heart syndrome at a rate of 169 cases per million in Missouri in 2011, the same year a massive tornado ripped through the state's town of Joplin, demolishing neighborhoods and killing at least 158 people. 'Despite the seemingly increasing number of natural disasters we have, there is limited data about how it might affect the heart,' said Dr Sadip Pant, lead investigator of the study. Vermont, which fell victim to Hurricane Irene in the same year, also had one of the highest rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Image shows flood damage in Quechee, near White River Junction. 'Our findings suggest two disasters, one in Vermont and one in Missouri, might have been possible triggers for the clustering of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases in these regions.' Patients with broken heart syndrome often complain of chest pain and shortness of breath, symptoms that mimic those of a heart attack, which can delay diagnosis. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke. Previous studies by the same group found that as many as one in four patients with broken heart syndrome have some form of arrhythmia and one to seven per cent suffer cardiac arrest. Many patients are diagnosed once doctors see there are no blockages in the artery, or imaging reveals changes in the shape of the heart that are characteristic of broken heart syndrome. Because natural disasters occur. more frequently in some parts of the country, residents in these regions. may have adapted to and experienced less stress during such. occurrences. A woman caught up in the 2003  Xinjiang earthquake, which destroyed the Chinese town. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke. However in places such as Vermont, where natural disasters are. relatively rare, people may be more susceptible to extreme stress when a. disaster hits particularly hard. 'By and large, it is a very reversible form of cardiomyopathy, but in the acute phase, these patients need to be monitored closely to be sure they are stable and to prevent and manage problems,' added Dr Pant. 'It's also something that emergency doctors and medical personnel need to be aware of as they are often on the frontlines seeing patients after disaster strikes. The authors add that different people's threshold for stress may also affect rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Gravestones tumbled over at cemetry at Jiganji temple in Ojiya, northern Japan after strong earthquakes in 2004. Rates of broken heart syndrome rose there shortly afterwards. Episodes are thought to be driven by the sympathetic response and surges of adrenaline in the body, similar to the well-known fight-or-flight reaction. This leads to depressed function of the apex and middle segment of the heart and increased contractility of the base producing a balloon-like appearance. 'It's a perfect example of our brain-heart connection,' said Dr Pant. 'The emotional stress we have in our brain can lead to responses in the heart, and not much is known about this condition.' The research was presented at the American. College of Cardiology's 63rd Annual Scientific Session.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Q:Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  The blood vessels of two different people are being studied at a laboratory. Jim's blood vessels are narrowing, and Bob's blood vessels are widening. This information alone doesn't tell the scientists much about Jim and Bob so they will need to run more tests to see if there are issues with the blood.  Is the amount of blood flowing through Bob's blood vessels increasing or decreasing?

"Question: ""What was worshipped in Comte's proposed religion?""  Context: ""Eliot and her circle, who included her companion George Henry Lewes (the biographer of Goethe) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau, were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte, whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to ""vivre pour altrui"" (""live for others"", from which comes the word ""altruism""), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.""

"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Instead of a normal court hearing, the trial on Wednesday appeared more like a prepared drama. Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning ""shocking"" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a ""performance"" by the lawyers. ""It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,"" Wu said. ""Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients  to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case."" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, ""but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers"", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. ""It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal. Although judgments should not be affected by public opinion, it's hard for them not to be,"" he said, suggesting judicial authorities should speak out if the case goes wrongly. Trials must be conducted based on evidence, while lawyers should protect their clients' rights instead of adding fuel to the flames, Yi said. In my eyes, the most important aspect of the case, lies in how to make lawyers do their work more professionally and reasonably. Question: From Yi Shenghua, we know that   _  .

"Lawrence was born Victoria Ann Axelrad in Inglewood, California, the daughter of Anne Alene (nee Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for Max Factor. The family surname was legally changed to ""Lawrence"" when Vicki was young. She is a graduate of Morningside High School in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist.

As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on The Carol Burnett Show, of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After The Carol Burnett Show ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.  Her portrayal of the Mama character on The Carol Burnett Show's ""The Family"" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom Mama's Family, elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show.  Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms Laverne & Shirley, Major Dad, Roseanne, Hannah Montana, and Yes, Dear. Between the NBC and syndication runs of Mama's Family, Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot Anything for Love, which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred Lauren Tewes and Rebeca Arthur. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and Tim Conway in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on Nunsense Jamboree that originally aired on TNN in 1998.  Lawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of Robby Ray Stewart and grandmother of Jackson and Miley Stewart) in the hit Disney series Hannah Montana alongside Billy Ray Cyrus and his daughter Miley Cyrus.  Lawrence recently played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio.

"Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What does taking refuge in the Three Jewels reveal? Context: Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking ""refuge in the triple gem"" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

"Given the below context:  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is ""Yarila"" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: ""The likeness is too close to be coincidental"". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: ""One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps"".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, ""The Great Sacrifice"" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite...  Guess a valid title for it!

"Answer the following question: Question: ""How was the CAF struggling?""  Context: ""In 2008 the Government of Canada made efforts, through the Canada First Defence Strategy, to modernize the Canadian Armed Forces, through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness, as well as the establishment of the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.""

Young lawyer Emily Reed travels to New York City for an interview with an international law firm, which immediately offers her a job on the condition that she can fly to Rio de Janeiro the following morning. Emily agrees and is introduced to Claudia Dennis, one of the firm's top executives. They arrive in Rio to finalize the purchase of a hotel, but angry Claudia must fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to meet the hotel's owner. Claudia instructs Emily to cover her date for the night. While viewing the hotel, Emily sees two locals having animalistic sex, which unnerves her and she returns to her own hotel. She meets Claudia's date; a wealthy man named James Wheeler. They have dinner, accompanied by James' bodyguards. James intrigues Emily; he is quiet and asks personal questions without being demanding or rude. After dinner, they attend a street carnival; Emily leaves after a masked man who looks like James tries to seduce her. The next morning, Emily wakes to find James watching her. He gives her a bouquet of orchids and denies making advances to her the previous evening, and as an apology, he offers to show her the city. She is initially reluctant but consents; they attend a party with a married couple that they noticed in the restaurant the night before. Some navy sailors at the party try to make advances on the wife; James fights them and he, Emily, and the couple leave quickly in his limousine. The married couple is having marital problems because of the wife's infidelity. She wants to reconcile with her husband. James encourages the couple to have sex in the limo, which they do. Emily finds their actions disturbing. Emily and James then visit the hotel that her firm wants to buy, and she tells James that she fears he would disappear if she touched him. When Emily hugs James, he pulls away from her, telling her that he does not like to be touched.

"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What three tracks did Kaye single out from the Christ Illusion album?  ""Jihad""—alongside fellow Christ Illusion album tracks ""Eyes of the Insane"" and ""Cult""—was made available for streaming on June 26, 2006, via the Spanish website Rafabasa.com. The album was Slayer's ninth studio recording, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews ""Jihad"" received a mixed reception. Blabbermouth's Don Kaye gave the opinion that ""a handful of songs"" on Christ Illusion ""are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well"", and specifically singled out the track: ""I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'."" Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song is ""predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda."" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for ""difficult"" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in ""Angel of Death"" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in ""213"" and ""Dead Skin Mask""—with great effect. But here it feels atypically crass and exploitative, as if it was done purely to get a rise out of people... And Slayer's usually a lot more clever than that. Not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of Allmusic observed that ""the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape."" The Austin Chronicle's Marc Savlov asked readers to ""listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in 'Jihad,' with Araya playing the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly.""King would have appointed ""Jihad"" as the group's nomination in the ""Best Metal Performance"" award category at the 49th Grammy Awards, deeming the chosen track ""Eyes of the Insane"" ""the poorest representations"" of the group on ninth studio album Christ...

"Mali:

In January 2012 a Tuareg rebellion began in Northern Mali, led by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad. In March, military officer Amadou Sanogo seized power in a coup d'état, citing Touré's failures in quelling the rebellion, and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the Economic Community of West African States. The MNLA quickly took control of the north, declaring independence as Azawad. However, Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), who had helped the MNLA defeat the government, turned on the Tuareg and took control of the North with the goal of implementing sharia in Mali.

"Here is a news article: Washington (CNN) The U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency said Monday it arrested more than 2,000 people as part of a five-day sweep aimed at detaining fugitive immigrants associated with gangs and other criminal backgrounds. 
  
 The enforcement operation was called ""Cross Check"" and targeted ""the worst of the worst criminals,"" said Alejandro Mayorkas, deputy secretary of Homeland Security, at a Monday news conference. 
  
 Of the 2,059 arrested, nearly half had felony convictions; 400 of them were for aggravated felonies. Fifty-eight were known gang members and 89 are convicted sex offenders. Nearly 500 individuals snared by the operation had re-entered the U.S. after previous deportations. 
  
 The arrestees came from 94 different countries and 163 of the cases will be presented to the U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, including a Polish citizen convicted in Hartford, Connecticut, for possession of cocaine; a Jamaican man in Atlanta, Georgia, who was convicted of a number of criminal charges, including assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer; and a Finnish citizen in Illinois convicted of possessing child pornography.

 NORFOLK -- Officers with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 2,000 foreign nationals convicted of crimes in the United States last week. 
  
 The arrests were made as part of a nation-wide operation called Operation Cross Check. The effort is aimed at deporting immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. 
  
 In November, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson issued a new directive that established priorities for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. 
  
 ""Priority 1 targets include threats to national security, criminal street gang members, convicted felons and aggravated felons,"" a DHS spokesman said. ""Priority 2 targets have convictions for three or more misdemeanors or convictions for significant misdemeanors, including DUIs."" 
  
 In Hampton Roads, Operation Cross Check netted in four administrative arrests on immigration charges. Federal privacy laws protect the names and identities of those detained on immigration charges. 
  
 The four immigrants detained include three men who entered or re-entered the country illegally. Two of the four had been convicted on DUI charges. One man--who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States--was issued a notice to appear in immigration court after being convicted of selling cocaine in a school zone. 
  
 One man that was arrested as part of the operation had been deported in the 1990s but re-entered the US and was convicted of DUI. 
  
 ""Based on the fact that he illegally re-entered the United States and has now been convicted of driving under the influence, he's somebody we don't want here in the United States,"" Acting Deputy Field Office Director Matt Munroe explained. 
  
 In addition to the four people who were arrested as part of the operation, ICE officers attempted to find a fifth man who was convicted of a sex crime involving a minor in 2003, among other charges. 
  
 Walter Antonio Larios-Hernandez, originally from El Salvador, has been added to ICE's national list of most wanted suspects. 
  
 Munroe said getting criminals like Larios-Hernandez out of local neighborhoods is the number one goal of Operation Cross Check. 
  
 ""These operations are targeting criminal aliens, aliens that have been convicted of crimes. We've arrested over 2,400 aliens that have criminal convictions,"" Munroe said. ""We've taken them out of the community, removed that threat to the community from these convicted criminals and have deported them from the United States.""

"Article:The island's previous Independent-led administration lodged an appeal after the High Court ruled in favour of a father who took his child on holiday.
The Supreme Court challenge to that ruling is due to be heard next week.
Conservative Chris Whitehouse said the case should have been dropped after the initial magistrates' hearing in 2015.
Mr Whitehouse, who became executive member for children's services after the Conservatives took control of the council last week, said: ""I have not changed my position on the school absences case, it should have been dropped immediately after the magistrates' hearing.
""I am limited in what I can say formally about this case because of a legal agreement entered into by my predecessor on behalf of the council.
""I intend to take further independent legal advice and may issue a purely personal statement in due course.""
The Supreme Court hearing, due to be heard on Tuesday 31 January, follows months of legal wrangling over the case of Jonathan Platt, who was fined Â£120 after taking his daughter to Florida.
When magistrates concluded Mr Platt had no case to answer because his daughter had attended school regularly, Isle of Wight Council appealed to the High Court, which also ruled in favour of Mr Platt.
The latest challenge was launched by the then Independent-led council on the request of Schools Minister Nick Gibb, with a commitment from the Department for Education (DfE) to meet the council's costs.
A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Our position remains that children should not be taken out of school without good reason.
""That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence.
""The evidence shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs.""

She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty.

She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.

"By. Lizzie Edmonds. PUBLISHED:. 05:25 EST, 30 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:24 EST, 30 December 2013. This is the terrifying moment a teen robber holds up a shop at gunpoint - all for 24 cans of beer. George Banister, 19, pulled the weapon on the horrified shop keeper in the West End of Newcastle. He then threatened to shoot shopkeeper Mohammed Rafiq, who bravely chased the teen out of his shop. Robbery: George Banister, 19, is caught on camera holding up a Newcastle shop for the sake of a few cans of beer. The thug later posted a picture of himself posing in a mask and holding the gun on Facebook. Banister was a known offender in the area and admitted robbery and a series of other assaults at Newcastle Crown Court. He was jailed for 6 years. Sending him to a young offender. institution, Judge Brian Forster QC told him: 'You pulled an imitation. weapon and threatened to shoot the shop owner and you later boasted. about it on Facebook. 'The courts have to protect local shopkeepers and deter people from behaving in the way you behaved. 'You answer for terrifying repeated acts of violence and you show no regard for other members of the community.' The court heard how Banister and another 17-year-old went into Fenham Discount Store about 5pm on August 9. The youth then stole a pack of 24 cans of lager and left the shop, moments before Banister came in pointing a gun at the shopkeeper. Despite chasing the raider out of his shop, he was unable to get the stolen beer back. Two. hours after the robbery Banister was bragging on Facebook about having. committed it, wearing a mask and posing with the BB gun he used in the. raid. Jailed: Career criminal Banister was jailed for six years after he admitted robbery and a series of other assaults. Caroline McGuirk, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant threatened to shoot the shop owner, who nevertheless pursued him. 'Mr. Rafiq said he was very scared when the weapon was pointed at him but he. felt he couldn’t let them get away with it so he chased them. 'He says the incident has caused him a lot of stress, harassment and fear.' This is not the only of Banister's shocking crimes. Last January Banister assaulted Abigail Pollard, who hours later tragically hanged herself. Abigail had been fighting with another woman outside Switch bar, in Newcastle, when Banister waded in, attacking both. He punched the other woman in the face twice then dragged Abigail across the road and kicked and stamped on her head. Miss. McGuirk said: 'Later that day she hanged herself. She visited a place. where a family member had committed suicide a year before and, using the. same tree, she hanged herself. 'There is no direct evidence to say this assault contributed but it can’t have helped her state of mind.' In July Banister got involved in another fight between two women on Adair Avenue, Benwell. He racially abused one of the women, spat at her and punched her in the head. When the other woman asked who he thought he was, Banister replied: 'I’m George Banister, you have some ammonia', and threw the burning substance in her face. Banister was involved in more city centre violence in December last year when he and another attacked several men in an unprovoked attack outside Sinner’s Bar. And while under arrest at North Tyneside police station, Banister bit a detention officer’s hand. Banister, of no fixed address, who already had 39 previous convictions, admitted robbery, possessing an imitation firearm, six assaults and racially aggravated assault. The youth who stole the beer got an absolute discharge at magistrates court for theft.

"TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie today killed the controversial, multi-billion dollar Hudson River commuter train tunnel — America’s largest public works project — ending for now the two-decade-old quest to expand train capacity between New Jersey and midtown Manhattan. 
  
 “I have made a pledge to the people of New Jersey that on my watch I will not allow taxpayers to fund projects that run over budget with no clear way of how these costs will be paid for,” said the governor. “Considering the unprecedented fiscal and economic climate our State is facing, it is completely unthinkable to borrow more money and leave taxpayers responsible for billions in cost overruns. 
  
 Christie said the tunnel project costs “far more than New Jersey taxpayers can afford and the only prudent move is to end this project.” 
  
 James Weinstein, the executive director of NJ Transit, in a statement, said while the state recognized the importance and value of a cross-Hudson transportation improvement project, “the current economic climate in New Jersey simply does not allow for this project to continue considering the substantial additional costs that are required.” 
  
 The governor said he has directed the state’s transportation officials to explore other approaches to modernize and expand rail capacity into New York. “However, any future project must recognize the regional and national scale of such an effort and work within the scope of the State’s current fiscal and economic realities,” he said. 
  
 Christie called a 30-day temporary halt in September on new tunnel construction, as behind-the-scenes cost projections suggested the tunnel project costs would swell more than $1 billion above the $8.7 million proposed price tag. He said he didn’t want the New Jersey version of Boston’s ""Big Dig"" — a tunnel mega-project that saw the final tally climb to nearly ten times the original $2.8 billion estimate. 
  
 At the same time, the governor was confronted with the state’s nearly bankrupt Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for road and bridge repairs and transit services. Christie had vowed not to increase the gas tax to pay for the fund, saying that drivers already had to contend with New Jersey Turnpike toll hikes and state residents already have been taxed too much, and there has been growing speculation that Christie will shift the state’s share of the tunnel project into the trust fund. 
  
 The federal government has earmarked $3 billion for the tunnel project, with another $3 billion being funded by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the final $2.7 billion coming from the state of New Jersey. Christie said the federal commitment is capped at $3 billion and required that any costs above $8.7 billion be absorbed by the State of New Jersey. According to the governor, cost overruns are estimated to be in a range from more than $2 billion to over $5 billion. ||||| Many reports that Chris Christie is about to scuttle the second rail tunnel under the Hudson. If so, it’s arguably the worst policy decision ever made by the government of New Jersey — and that’s saying a lot. 
  
 The story seems to be that Christie wants to divert the funds to road and bridge repair; but in so doing he would (a) lose huge matching funds from the Port Authority and the Feds (b) delay indefinitely a project NJ needs desperately ASAP. He could avoid these consequences by raising gasoline taxes. But no, taxes must never be raised, no matter what the tradeoffs. 
  
 And it’s a social bad too: now is very much the time when we should be ramping up infrastructure spending, not cutting it. 
  
 Awesome. 
  
 And yes, if anyone should mention it, I am a resident of New Jersey who often visits Manhattan, and therefore has a personal stake in this project. You got a problem with that? |||||

"Grieving family and friends cried as the body of Srinivas Kuchibhotla was cremated in the southern city of Hyderabad, where he was from.
He and another Indian man were drinking in a bar in Kansas when they were shot by a man who reportedly yelled ""get out of my country"" as he fired at them.
Authorities are investigating if the attack was racially motivated.
The man's uncle, PL Narayana, described his family's agony upon learning about the violent attack.
""It is so cruel. He was such a kind soul, very friendly.
""He was so excited that he and his wife were going to start a family soon. Now this has happened,"" Mr Narayana said.
The body of Kuchibohotla, an engineer who worked for GPS-maker Garmin in Kansas City, arrived in India on Monday.
His widow, Sunayana Dumala and his brother, Sai Kiran, who studied in the US, both returned to India for the funeral.
Nearly 200 people came to the the cremation, which was also attended by Bandaru Dattatreya, the union minister of state for labour.
Hours after his arrival, his flower-laden body was carried from his family home in the state of Telangana to a crematorium where he was burned on a wooden pyre, in accordance with Hindu tradition.
Kuchibhotla's mother wailed as the body was taken for cremation.
""I had asked him to return to India if he was feeling insecure there. But he used to say he was safe and secure,"" she said through tears.
""Now I want my younger son Sai Kiran and his family to come back for good. I will not allow them to go back.
""My son had gone there in search of a better future. What crime did he commit?""
Kuchibhotla and his friend, Alok Madasani, were both shot at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, a Kansas City suburb, last Wednesday evening.
Mr Madasani told the BBC that the gunman had demanded to know if they were in the country legally.
The suspected attacker, Adam Purinton, 51, was arraigned in court on Monday on charges of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder.
He fled the scene after the shooting, and later told a bartender that he had ""shot two Iranians"".
The suspect, a US Navy veteran, is being held in the Johnson County Jail on a bond of $2m (Â£1.6m).
His next court appearance is on 9 March.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name ""Civilian"" (or ""The Civilian Project""). According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, ""weren't even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind."" To MTV, he described them as ""inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on. Someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website. Then it went global and everyone thought they had the record, which was so frustrating."", can you guess it ?

"So I had my daughter and one of her friends with me and decided to brave a Costco visit.  They have lots of samples and toys.  We tried a lot of samples, but didn't play with the toys much this visit.  We went to gets some cheese for the cheese fair on Wednesday at my daughter's after school program.  So naturally, what would take me five minutes turned into half an hour.  I picked up a pack of Babybel Cheese for the cheese fest and headed to the cashiers.  As usual, there was a longer-than-the-supermarket wait.  It's finally my turn, and I give the cashier my card, and he tells me that it is expired.  ""Can we get a manager on aisle 4 please!!""  So the manager comes over, and the cashier pleads my case like a champ, ""His card expired and he just wants to get the bag of cheese, he'll renew next time.""  I would have renewed then, but, of course, my MasterCard and Visa are no good at Costco.  I have the cash for the cheese, but not for the renewal as well.  The manager looks at my accounts and tells me that it has been expired since May, and that he can't let me buy the cheese.  So apparently my wife and I hadn't been to Costco since before May, but I'm sure it appeared as if I were a serial non-renewer.  That might be plausible if I weren't buying a single 24 pack of Babybels.  Yeah, I'm refusing to renew so that I can buy well priced cheese wrapped in wax.  The wax is actually really cool.  So I lower my head in shame, gather up the kids, leave the cheese, am given back my expired card with a ""you don't want to forget this,"" and head for the door to tell the people who make sure that you aren't shoplifting that there is nothing to check because I couldn't get the cheese for my daughter's cheese tasting.  By the way, I chucked the card because it was obviously the cards fault, or maybe I just didn't want the reminder.

The poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 16 August 1904. Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustan -- the land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara.

"This article: The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south.  However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained.  On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: ""At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!"" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land ""Hvidtenland"" (""White Island""). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was apparent that they were in an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land.

This turbulent decade marked by the end of 350 years of Dutch occupation, entry and commencement of Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, and the return of the Netherlands who tried to get Indonesia back as part of their Dutch Empire, which led to the Indonesian National Revolution. Soegija wrote all these events in his diary reflections, and also its participation in relieving the suffering of people in the midst of the chaos of war. He tried to play a role at all levels, local politics, national and international. (For his participation, President Sukarno awarded him with the title of National Hero of Indonesia.)

You can go about selecting a church in a number of different ways, depending on your history with religion and what's available in your area, but it's important to find a church that's close and convenient so you can feel like part of the community. Most people have some sense of their beliefs, but many people are also interested in exploring what's available locally. You shouldn't have to travel far to go to church.  Start local. If you're an Episcopalian, find out what Episcopal churches there are in your community and attend all of them to pick which one fits you best. If you weren't raised with any belief system and want to explore your options, find out the variety of different churches and religions practiced in your town and make a few visits. Do some reading about them to find out if they line up with your personal beliefs, then explore them at a service as a visitor. If you live around the corner from an Apostolic church, it may be convenient to attend, but it may also be very different from what you're used to at other Christian churches. On the other hand, it may fit in perfectly with your personal beliefs and needs for a religious practice. Do some reading on the beliefs and practices of the religions before you attend to help you narrow your search for a church community. You don't need to be an expert about religion to go to church. Most church-goers are excited and friendly, happy to welcome new potential members and visitors to their service. Church is supposed to be a learning experience, so don't let your ignorance of a particular religion keep you from attending. Keep an open mind and open heart. In larger towns and increasingly in rural communities, mega-churches with large memberships and parking structures are increasingly common. While these appeal to lots of believers because they are easy to attend, it can also be somewhat difficult to get to know anyone at your church if you're attending a service in a sports arena. Try out smaller churches to see what works. Give both a shot. If you're a member of a small community church with a broken-down organ, you might try exploring a larger church with bigger production values to see if it helps you engage more. Alternatively, you might be able to get in touch more profoundly at a simple, humble, country church. Even if you're fairly settled on your religious preferences and your desires for a church community, try exploring your options as a learning experience. There might be something better out there for you, something that feels right and comforts. If you know definitively that you’re a Christian, or a Muslim, or a Sufi, it’s still important to explore the different churches within that religion in your area to find one that feels comfortable. Fellowship is just as important a part of worshiping at a church as the tenants of the religion itself.

Movie title: Holiday Inn Context: Famous showbiz trio breaks up, as crooner Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) plans to take his fiancée Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale) out to Connecticut to live on a farm and enjoy the lazy life. The problem is that suave dancer Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) has stolen Lila from Jim and runs off with her to continue their showbiz careers. Farming does not prove as easy as Jim had hoped and after a year, he ends up having a nervous breakdown. In the sanitarium, Jim comes up with the idea to turn his old barn into a nightclub that is only open on holidays.

"– The US Postal Service is planning to finally replace a 163,000-strong fleet of delivery vehicles that have been in service since before Amazon.com sold its first book. The familiar Grumman LLVs now in service were built between 1987 and 1994. Upkeep for the aging vehicles has become a huge drain on USPS resources, and with the trucks only getting around 10 miles to the gallon, the service spent almost $540 million on fuel alone in the last fiscal year, reports the Wall Street Journal; the paper notes that General Motors is among those chasing a contract for 180,000 ""next-generation"" vehicles expected to be worth around $5 billion. In a blog post, the USPS describes fleet replacement as an opportunity to include modern safety and environmental features in its vehicles, as well as to address the huge growth in package delivery with new vehicle designs that ""could address the challenges of larger and irregularly shaped items."" But the Journal notes it's still unclear where the cash-strapped Postal Service is going to find $5 billion for a new fleet of vehicles when it has already reached its $15 billion credit limit with the Treasury and lost more than $5 billion in the last fiscal year. (Alaskan subsidies alone have cost the service more than $2.5 billion over the last few decades.)

"Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means ""country of the west"" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

"News article:

Brazil is building a giant observation tower in the heart of the Amazon to monitor climate change and its impact on the region's sensitive ecosystem, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
  
 The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) is a project of Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research and Germany's Max Planck Institute, O Estado de Sao Paulo said. 
  
 The tower, which will rise 325 meters (over 1,000 feet) from the ground, will be equipped with high-tech instruments and an observatory to monitor relationships between the jungle and the atmosphere. 
  
 It will gather data on heat, water, carbon gas, winds, cloud formation, carbon absorption and weather patterns. 
  
 The ATTO project has been seven years in the making, with a site finally being selected far from any human presence, about 100 miles (170 kilometers) from Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, project coordinator Antonio Manzi told the newspaper. 
  
 The steel structure has been transported to the site on trucks and rafts from southern Brazil, nearly 2,500 miles away. 
  
 The Amazon jungle is one of the world's most sensitive ecosystems, with a powerful influence on the atmospheric release or intake of carbon. 
  
 ""The tower will help us answer innumerable questions related to global climate change,"" said Paulo Artaxo, a project coordinator from the University of Sao Paulo. 
  
 ""We will gain a better understanding of the role of the Amazon and other humid tropical areas in climate models."" 
  
 ym/jm/pst ||||| Image caption The Amazon rainforest is responsible for absorbing tonnes of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere 
  
 Construction has begun on a giant observation tower in the heart of the Amazon basin to monitor climate change. 
  
 The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory is expected to rise 325m from the ground. 
  
 Its instruments will gather data on greenhouse gases, aerosol particles and the weather in one of the largest continuous rain forests on the planet. 
  
 Brazilian and German scientists hope to use the data to better understand sources of greenhouse gases and answer questions on climate change. 
  
 The tower is being constructed out of steel that was brought thousands of kilometres from the south of Brazil to the site, about 160km (100 miles) from the Amazonian city of Manaus. 
  
 Because of its height, the tower will make it possible to investigate the alteration and movement of air masses through the forest over a distance of several hundred kilometres. 
  
 ""The measurement point is widely without direct human influence, and therefore ideal to investigate the meaning of the forest region for the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere,"" said Jurgen Kesselmeier, the project coordinator for the German side, quoted on the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz website. 
  
 The Amazon jungle is one of the world's most sensitive ecosystems, with a powerful influence on the intake and release of carbon into the atmosphere. 
  
 ""The tower will help us answer innumerable questions related to global climate change,"" said Paulo Artaxo, from the University of Sao Paulo. 
  
 The tower will be integrated into an existing structure of smaller measuring towers in the region. 
  
 When finished, it will complement a similar observatory built in 2006 that already stands in Central Siberia. |||||

"Adam Mitchel Lambert (born January 29, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter and stage actor. Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide. Lambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol. Later that year, he released his debut album, For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200.

Critics, celebrities and colleagues have been outspoken in their praise for Lambert's vocal command. Kathie Bretches-Urban, co-founder of Metropolitan Educational Theatre Network (now MET2) where Lambert performed as a youth, said ""He has invested his entire life in music and performing ... He'd just come out onstage, and it popped"". Record producer Rob Cavallo once described Lambert as having an unlimited range, and able to sing every note on a guitar from the lowest to the highest. In a March 2012 interview, rock artist Meat Loaf rated Lambert's voice in the company of only two others, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, based on ""that jet pack quality to their voice that just lets it take off."" Lambert's total recorded vocal range spans from bass E to B flat above tenor high C (E2 - B5), giving him three octaves and six semitones.  In 2011, when he took the stage at the MTV Europe Music Awards, honoree Queen guitarist Brian May noted that Lambert's voice has ""sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop""; while Roger Taylor added that Lambert had ""the best range I've ever heard"" in a BBC interview in 2012. Pharrell Williams, after collaborating with Lambert on his Trespassing album, commented, ""This kid has a voice like a siren - there's no guys singing in that Steve Winwood-Peter Cetera range.""  In October 2012, British tabloid the Sunday Mirror reported that Lambert had insured his voice for $48 million. A source told the newspaper: ""Insurance for stars is a big deal in the US and Adam's voice is his bacon.""

Movie title: Practical Magic Movie plot: When Maria, the witch ancestor of our protagonists, realizes that her lover is never going to come for her, she casts a spell on herself to never fall in love again. Unfortunately, the spell goes awry and becomes a family curse: any man that falls for an Owens woman will die. And that's exactly what happens to Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens' father, causing their mother to die of a broken heart. The young girls then live with their two aunts (Stockard Channing, Diane Wiest), who teach them the ways of being a witch and how to deal with the ridicule that comes with the family profession. But one night when they witness their aunts casting a love spell for a neighbor, Sally decides she will never fall in love and dreams up a man that will never exist...Until one day she goes to town with her aunts and she meets the man she falls for. The next thing you know, Sally is happily married to Michael (Mark Feuerstein) with two daughters of her very own. Her sister, in the mean time, has been living in Florida where life is constant parties.But when the 'death watch beetle' sounds, Sally know it is only a matter of time before she loses Michael like her mother lost her father...and like all the Owens women have lost the men they love.

"Updated at 5:10 EST with audio of the call. 
  
 Updated at 6:12pm EST with confirmation that the call did indeed come from the Santorum campaign 
  
 LANSING, MI — Rick Santorum’s campaign is locked in a tight battle with Mitt Romney ahead of Tuesday’s Michigan primary. On Monday his camp started openly courting a demographic that’s not often reached out to in GOP primaries: Democrats. 
  
 Michigan’s primary rules allow Dems to vote in the state’s GOP primaries. The liberal site DailyKos and other progressive partners have been trying to drum up enthusiasm for “Operation Hilarity” - an effort to get Democrats to vote in the GOP primary and tilt the vote against Mitt Romney. The Santorum campaign evidently decided they’d take votes from any legitimate source. 
  
 Following some speculation that the robocall may have been a “false flag” effort designed to harm Santorum, a spokesman Hogan Gidley confirmed to TPM that they were indeed footing the bill, and reaching beyond party lines. “If we can get the Reagan Democrats in the primary, we can get them in the general,” he told TPM. 
  
 It’s a controversial tactic. Bill Ballenger, a longtime Michigan politico and the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, spoke with TPM about the call earlier in the day. He said the call piqued his interest because it sounded like it could have come from a union targeting Romney ahead of the Feb. 28 primary. The call focuses on Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout and calls on Democrats to vote for Santorum Tuesday because of it. 
  
 “It went on and on like this and I kept listening because I kind of smelled a rat,” Ballenger said. “And finally at the very end, in a tagline it says, ‘this call was paid for by the Santorum for president committee.’” 
  
  
  
 TPM readers in Michigan reported Monday receiving the same robocall as Ballenger. TPM Reader BG emailed in to say he’d received a robocall where the “voice sounded Union-ish” and “said the word ‘Democrats’ repeatedly, though not as a derogatory label.” He stayed on to hear who claimed the call in the tagline at the end and “yup, it was from the official Santorum campaign.” 
  
 TPM obtained audio of the call from a reader in Trenton, MI who said it showed up on his answering machine Monday morning. Ballenger confirmed the call was the one he heard. 
  
 I asked Ballenger, who’s followed many elections in Michigan, if the Santorum call classifies as playing dirty. 
  
 “This is a dirty trick,” he said. “I mean, first of all you know how these robocalls are. You get one, generally speaking, you kind of after the first couple of sentences you know what they’re after. If you don’t hang up right away you get the message, right? Well, most people don’t listen all the way through [and] you have to listen to the bitter end of this one to get the clincher. Otherwise, you’d hang up and you’d be convinced this came out of UAW Solidarity House or the Obama reelection campaign.” 
  
 What’s more, Ballenger said, the messenger delivering an attack on Romney for opposing the auto bailout is a little disingenuous. 
  
 “You talk about chutzpah: here’s Santorum who’s just as opposed to the bailout as Romney is, but he’s putting out robocalls to Democrats urging them to crossover and vote in the Republican for Santorum,” Ballenger said. “The only thing intellectually in the whole message that it seems to be the Santorum committee could use to justify this tactic is the one line that, you know, ‘Romney was all too happy to support bailing out Wall Street, but not Michigan.’ Santorum is in the position all along of ‘a plague on both their houses. No bailouts for anybody.’” 
  
 There’s already another controversy about a pro-Santorum robocall which is tagged as coming from the National Rifle Association, but which the gun rights organization denies it is running. 
  
 David Taintor contributed to the reporting for this article. ||||| Mitt Romney is calling Rick Santorum's calls to Democrats to vote in Tuesday's primary in Michigan ""outrageous"" and ""disgusting"" but Santorum says he's not doing anything besides getting people to vote in an open primary. 
  
 Romney complained about the automated calls Tuesday, as Michigan voters go to the polls in the Republican presidential primary. Arizona also votes Tuesday in a winner-take-all battle, but Michigan, with its proportional delegate award system, has added value since Romney was born in the state and his father served as governor there. 
  
 ""I know why Obama doesn't want me to face him but I just think it's outrageous and a terrible dirty trick at the last hour, by the way, late in the afternoon on the day before the election, maybe hoping no one would notice, they start sending out calls to Democrats, union members telling them to go into the Republican primary and vote against Mitt Romney,"" he said. 
  
 ""This is a new low for his campaign and that's saying something,"" Romney told Fox News 
  
 Santorum told Fox News on Monday night that he is trying to attract the Democratic voters he'll need in a general election campaign. He added that nothing he's said in his robo-call is any worse than the campaign Romney has run. 
  
 ""When he runs a robo-call of my voice from four years ago saying good things about him, that's not a low moment, and when I run a call basically saying, calling Democrats that are eligible to vote here, to vote for us, that's a low (moment)?"" he said. 
  
 ""And of course, you know, it's interesting that he criticizes me for attracting Democrats because one of the things that the Governor Romney's people say is, oh, he can't attract Democrats. Well, guess what? We will wait and see. I think we can."" 
  
 The robocall going around Monday says Democrats should send ""a loud message"" to Romney by voting for Santorum. The message says it's supported by ""hard-working Democratic men and women"" and paid for by the Santorum campaign. 
  
 Indeed, Democrats have made no bones about their efforts to force a Romney loss in the GOP primary. The pro-President Obama super PAC, Moveon.org and the campaign itself have all run ads against Romney in the Wolverine State. 
  
 On Monday, liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote that a ""million-dollar anti-Romney effort (with much of that money coming from Democrats and progressives) has dragged Romney back down to where Santorum can catch him."" 
  
 He added that ""the big-money campaign"" aims to drive down Romney's numbers among independents and the Michigan Democratic Party is also engaged in getting Democrats to cast votes for Santorum, ""reminding them that casting such votes in no way prohibits them from voting in Democratic contests later in the year."" 
  
 ""The quicker Romney can transition to 'general election' mode, the quicker he can move to the center and start repairing the damage. And as long as Santorum drives the debate, he helps galvanize base Democratic constituencies. ... There is no downside to dragging this contest out a month or two longer,"" Kos wrote. 
  
 While the two candidates run neck-and-neck -- late polling showing virtually no difference between the two -- Santorum is also asking volunteers to come out Tuesday night to ""help in ensuring the accuracy of ballots collected."" 
  
 Whoever wins in Michigan, the 30 delegate count will only go a small way toward gaining the 1,144 required to win the party nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. 
  
 So far, The Associated Press has tallied 123 delegates for Romney to 72 for Santorum. Newt Gingrich, who is focused on Washington state caucuses Saturday, with 40 delegates at stake and Super Tuesday states next week and not Tuesday's battle in Michigan, has 32 delegates and Ron Paul has 19. Next Tuesday's 10 primaries and caucuses will gin up another 419 delegates. 
  
 But Michigan's battle would follow a three-state sweep by Santorum earlier in the month, which while not awarding delegates yet, forced Romney into a bit of a defensive mode in Michigan. He hosted nearly a dozen public events as he and his allies have spent more than $2 million on local television advertising. 
  
 Romney predicted victory Monday night at the Royal Oak Music Theatre, where rocker-rapper Kid Rock performed. 
  
 ""I'm going to win in Michigan and I'm going to win across the country,"" Romney said. 
  
 Santorum, seeing fluctuations in polling, was more reserved on Monday night. 
  
 ""I think the fact that we are doing as well as we are is a pretty big deal in this state,"" he said. |||||

It was only last week, after all, that Ms. Sebelius, 65, said that she would step down from her cabinet job.

 Even if Ms. Sebelius had not presided over the Department of Health and Human Services at a time of turmoil and self-inflicted distress — and while carrying out a law that inspires such anger on the right — her candidacy would be a tough sell in Kansas. Democrats have not held a Senate seat in the state since 1939. And even before the president’s popularity started to take a steep slide last year, he fared especially poorly in Kansas, winning only 38 percent of the vote there in 2012. 
  
 Democrats say that Ms. Sebelius would be their best hope at winning in a tough state, especially if Mr. Roberts loses his primary to Milton Wolf, a Tea Party-backed radiologist who has alarmed mainstream Republicans with some of his actions, such as when he posted gruesome pictures of gunshot victims on Facebook. 
  
 Perhaps more significant, Ms. Sebelius would force Republicans to spend money in Kansas as they tried to fight off her challenge. Her family has a long history in the state, and she was a popular, twice-elected governor. In 2006, she was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote. 
  
 But friends and Democrats who know her said that they seriously doubted she would follow through and mount a campaign, considering how personally difficult the past six or seven months had been. She has been mocked and excoriated by Republicans on Capitol Hill, who made her the face of the Affordable Care Act’s problems. And she has told people that she anticipated staying on in her job as secretary for a while longer. President Obama has already nominated a successor, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget, but her appointment must be approved by the Senate. 
  
 Ms. Sebelius would have until June 2 to decide, the deadline for filing for the Senate primary in Kansas. ||||| Before she was President Barack Obama‘s embattled Health and Human Services secretary, tasked with overseeing the initial stages of the implementation the Affordable Care Act, Kathleen Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas. With her time in the administration behind her, reports indicate that Sebelius is openly contemplating a return to politics in her home state via a challenge to Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS). 
  
  
  
 The New York Times reports that Sebelius is “weighing revenge” against Roberts, a Sebelius family friend who reportedly wounded her when he accused her of “gross incompetence” as HHS secretary. 
  
 Roberts, who is currently running for a fourth term in the upper chamber of Congress, saw his job approval rating dip following a the report that he did not actually own a home in the state which he represents in Congress. After that report, the 77-year-old senator drew a primary challenge from a tea party-aligned candidate.

 “Democrats say that Ms. Sebelius would be their best hope at winning in a tough state, especially if Mr. Roberts loses his primary to Milton Wolf, a Tea Party-backed radiologist who has alarmed mainstream Republicans with some of his actions, such as when he posted gruesome pictures of gunshot victims on Facebook,” The Times reports. 
  
 Polls presently show Roberts leading Wolf among Kansas GOP primary voters and indicate that Roberts’ primary challenger is a flawed candidate. Roberts polls significantly worse against a generic “more conservative” Republican candidate than he does against Wolf, a condition that goes to show Kansas’ Republican electorate is ready to send new blood to Washington. 
  
 However, the last time Sebelius won a race in Kansas was in 2006, a year in which the political environment heavily favored Democrats seeking national and statewide office. Furthermore, a Democrat has not occupied a U.S. Senate seat from The Sunflower State since 1939. 
  
 In spite of Roberts’ troubles, Sebelius has an uphill battle if she wants to replace the aging Republican in Washington D.C. But the first step is floating a potential candidacy via “friends” in The New York Times.

"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China.

"Write some highlights for the following article:

A day after Rafael Nadal exited the Madrid Masters and vowed never to return while the clay is still blue, a similarly disgruntled Novak Djokovic suffered a shock 7-6 (2), 6-3 loss to fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic. The world No. 1 said he would join Nadal in boycotting the Madrid tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts. ""I want to forget this week as soon as possible and move on to the real clay courts,"" Djokovic said. ""It took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis. ""There is no discussion in my eyes, it's very simple. No blue clay for me."" Nadal lost to fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday for his earliest exit in a clay-court tournament in eight years. Verdasco was routed 6-1, 6-2 by Tomas Berdych in Friday's quarterfinals. The blue clay is the brainchild of tournament owner Ion Tiriac, who claims it helps fans see the ball and creates a better viewing experience. And while Djokovic and Nadal have crashed out, Roger Federer has thrived at the tournament, beating David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4 on Friday to advance to the semifinals. The 16-time Grand Slam champion, president of the ATP Players' Council, said he sympathized with Nadal and Djokovic. ""Yes of course, I said it from the start. It's not something we actually wanted,"" he said. ""I understand their frustrations. It's a bit tricky for everyone and we definitely have to look into things for next year."" Federer will replace Nadal at No. 2 in the rankings if he wins the tournament, thereby increasing his chances of being seeded second for the French Open. Federer, who didn't face a single break point against Ferrer, will play Tipsarevic in the semifinals, while Juan Martin del Potro meets Berdych in the other after a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov. Serena Williams, too, has been in blistering form in Madrid and won a battle of former No. 1s in typically ruthless style, thrashing Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-3 . Both players were unbeaten on clay coming into the match, but Williams extended her winning streak over the Russian to seven while winning her 10th straight match. Williams said the clay was ""extremely slippery"" but she wouldn't join the top men's stars in skipping Madrid next year. ""If I'm not here next year, it won't be because of the clay,"" said the 13-time Grand Slam champion. ""I don't think there's been any improvement in the courts over the week, but every clay court is different. ""This is not the best court -- definitely not  what they play like at Roland Garros -- but it's what they use at Madrid."" Williams will face Lucie Hradecka for a place in the final after the Czech qualifier upset  fifth-seeded Sam Stosur 7-6 (8), 7-6 (6).

"During the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a materialist conception of history centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity (practice, including labor) and the institutions created, reproduced, or destroyed by that activity (see materialist conception of history). Later Marxists developed the notion of dialectical materialism which characterized later Marxist philosophy and method.

"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child  for the following movie plot:  Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a prominent child psychologist, returns home one night with his wife, Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams), from an event in which he was honored for his work. His wife tells him that everything in the world is second to his job including her. The two discover they are not alone; a young man (Donnie Wahlberg) appears brandishing a gun. He says that he doesn't want to be afraid anymore and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Grey shoots Crowe in the lower abdomen, and seconds later turns the gun on himself.The next fall, Crowe begins working with another boy, nine year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has a condition similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to this patient, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife begins to fall apart due to his focus on work.Once Crowe earns his trust, Cole eventually confides in him that he ""sees dead people that walk around like regular people."" Though Crowe at first thinks Cole is delusional, he eventually comes to believe that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts, perhaps to aid them in their unfinished business on Earth. Cole at first does not want to, because the ghosts terrify him, but he soon decides to try it. One is an overworked wife abused by her husband who slit her wrists; another that tries to hurt Cole is only heard as a voice who starts calmly pleading to Cole to let him out of the dark cupboard because he's suffocating, then yells at Cole that he didn't steal ""the Master's horse"" and threatens to attack Cole if he doesn't obey. The third ghost appears very briefly; a boy a bit older than Cole asks him to come into the room, to find the boy's father's gun. The boy turns around to show that he has a large...

"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Options: A A term essay B A news report C An experiment report D An exploration review.

Q: Paragraph: The scientists, who treated the monkeys with a neuroprosthetic interface that acted as a wireless bridge between the brain and spine, say they have started small feasibility studies in humans to trial some components. “The link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord – to make this communication exist – is completely new,” said Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at the Lausanne University Hospital who surgically placed the brain and spinal cord implants in the monkey experiments. “For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface.”  Gregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) which led the work, cautioned that there are major challenges ahead and “it may take several years before this intervention can become a therapy for humans.”  Publishing their results in the journal Nature on Wednesday, the team said the interface works by decoding brain activity linked to walking movements and relaying that to the spinal cord – below the injury – through electrodes that stimulate neural pathways and activate leg muscles. In bypassing the injury and restoring communication between the brain and the relevant part of the spinal cord, the scientists successful treated two rhesus monkeys each with one leg paralyzed by a partial spinal cord lesion. One of the monkeys regained some use of its paralyzed leg within the first week after injury, without training, both on a treadmill and on the ground, while the other took around two weeks to recover to the same point. “We developed an implantable, wireless system that operates in real-time and enabled a primate to behave freely, without the constraint of tethered electronics,” said Courtine. “We understood how to extract brain signals that encode flexion and extension movements of the leg with a mathematical algorithm. We then linked the decoded signals to the stimulation of specific hotspots in the spinal cord that induced the walking movement.”  The brain and spinal cord can adapt and recover from small injuries, but until now that ability has been far too limited to overcome severe damage. Other attempts to repair spinal cords have focused on stem cell therapy and on combinations of electrical and chemical stimulation of the cord. Independent experts not directly involved in this work said it was an important step towards a potential future where paralyzed people may be able to walk again. Simone Di Giovanni, a specialist in restorative neuroscience at Imperial College London, said EPFL’s results were “solid, very promising and exciting” but would need to be tested further in more animals and in larger numbers. “In principle this is reproducible in human patients,” he said. “The issue will be how much this approach will contribute to functional recovery that impacts on the quality of life. This is still very uncertain.” Claim: Paralyzed monkeys walk again with wireless 'brain-spine interface'.

"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia?  Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the ""outward growth of the mind's scope"". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as ""the life force, the unquenchable will to live"".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...

"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question ""what is the second ethnicity mentioned?"" is in ""During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.

Five obstacles to peace
The evacuations are being carried out by military and chartered planes, as commercial flights have not yet resumed.
However, Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohammed has told the BBC that Kenyan nationals would not be evacuated, as the ceasefire in South Sudan was holding.
The US embassy in Juba said it was organising flights to evacuate non-essential staff and all US citizens wishing to leave.
President Barack Obama later announced 47 troops were being sent to protect the US embassy and its staff.
He added that 130 more personnel were being sent to Djibouti to stand ready for deployment if necessary.
Germany's foreign ministry said its air force was evacuating other European nationals, as well as its own citizens.
During the fighting, Mr Machar's base in Juba was overrun.
Mr Machar's spokesman James Gatdet Dak told the BBC that the vice-president was now near the capital but refused to be more specific.
He called for an international buffer force to be deployed to avoid ""further confrontation"" and ensure that the ceasefire holds.
July 2011 - South Sudan becomes an independent country after more than 20 years of guerrilla warfare, which claimed the lives of at least 1.5 million people and displaced more than four million.

"I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wants to restore voting rights to people convicted of nonviolent felonies, he said Sunday, previewing a bill he plans to introduce this week.

""I have a friend whose brother grew marijuana plants 30 years ago in college, has a felony conviction and still cannot vote,"" Paul said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" He added: ""I think that's wrong and unfair.""

Paul said preventing nonviolent felons from voting is a larger problem than the battle over voter ID laws. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to limit voting access through such laws.

""Republicans, I think, have been unfairly tarred as, oh, trying to suppress vote,"" Paul said. ""Here's a Republican who wants to enhance the vote. This is a much bigger problem than anything else limiting voting right now. Nearly a million people can't vote. And I want to help people get their right to vote back.""

He said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that his forthcoming bill ""would allow somewhere between a half-a-million people to a million people to get the right to vote back.""

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered.

"John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which lever would produce smaller increase in force, lever A or lever B?  Hint: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.

"Background: Sugarland is an American country music duo consisting of singer-songwriters Jennifer Nettles (lead vocals) and Kristian Bush (vocals, acoustic guitar, mandolin). Sugarland was founded in 2002 by Kristen Hall with Bush and became a trio after hiring Jennifer Nettles. Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland broke through that year with the release of their debut single ""Baby Girl"", the first single from their multi-platinum debut album Twice the Speed of Life.
Context: Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles paired with Pepsi Max and recorded a commercial for Super Bowl XLVI. Nettles recorded Hank Williams' ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" which is featured in the commercial as a Coke Zero delivery man tries to buy a Pepsi Max without being discovered.  Sugarland recorded a song for the 2012 movie, Act of Valor. The soundtrack to the movie was released on February 21, 2012. The song is titled ""Guide You Home"". Kristian Bush confirmed in late January that Sugarland will be touring in ""mid to late Spring"" and that they're ""going to source our fans for our set list."" On April 5, 2012, the duo commenced their fourth headlining tour: In Your Hands tour 2012. On June 18, it was announced that Nettles was pregnant and due in November, two months after their summer tour concluded. Her son, Magnus Hamilton Miller, was born on December 6, 2012.  With Nettles on maternity leave, Bush made his solo debut in March 2013 at the inaugural C2C: Country to Country Festival at the O2 Arena in London, England; his first song release as a solo act, ""Love or Money,"" debuted on iTunes in Europe the following week. He often takes part in the Country Music Association's Songwriters Series, which has included various appearances across the United States, as well as time spent abroad with the CMA's first-ever international initiative showcasing Nashville songwriters and their work to foreign audiences in clubs and theaters.

"Generate a question that has the following answer:  Barrigan tells him.  for the following movie plot:  In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello. Sullivan (Matt Damon) is warmly welcomed onto the State Police force by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg).Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), whose extended family has considerable ties to organized crime, also attends the police academy....

Input: Context: Early parenthood is a time of chronic sleep disturbance and also of heightened depression risk. Poor sleep quality has been identified both as a predictor of postpartum depressive symptoms and as a consequence.', 'This study sought to clarify causal pathways linking sleep and postpartum depression via longitudinal path modeling.

Within-couple associations between sleep and depression were also tested.', 'Data were drawn from a low-income, racially and ethnically diverse sample of 711 couples recruited after the birth of a child. Depressive symptoms were assessed at 1, 6, and 12\xa0months postpartum, and sleep was assessed at 6\xa0months postpartum.', ""For both partnered mothers and fathers and for single mothers, depressive symptoms at 1\xa0month postpartum predicted sleep quality at 6\xa0months, which in turn predicted depressive symptoms at both 6 and 12\xa0months.

"Paragraph: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. ""It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,"" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. ""There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward. Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent. So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,"" he said.

"Anne Hathaway admits she was faking it during her 2013 Oscar speech 
  
 CLOSE Anne Hathaway admitted that her 2013 Oscar acceptance speech was phony USA TODAY_Wibbitz 
  
 You can put your pitchforks down now, folks. 
  
 Anne Hathaway has finally admitted that her 2013 Oscar acceptance speech was phony but, as the well-meaning actress recently explained to The Guardian, Les Misérables — the film for which she won best supporting actress for her turn as the tragic Fantine — left her in a bad headspace. 
  
 ""I kind of lost my mind doing that movie and it hadn’t come back yet,"" the actress, who at one point subsisted off small amounts of porridge to lose 25 pounds for the role, says. 
  
 Beyond her taxing physical transformation, Hathaway also alludes to the psychological toll of researching and being immersed in that world. ""It’s an obvious thing, you win an Oscar and you’re supposed to be happy — I didn’t feel that way,"" she says. ""I felt wrong that I was standing there in a gown that cost more than some people are going to see in their lifetime, and winning an award for portraying pain that still felt very much a part of our collective experience as human beings."" 
  
 ""I tried to pretend that I was happy and I got called out on it, big time,"" Hathaway continues, referencing the poor reception of her speech, which was regarded as fake at best and smug at worst. 
  
 ""That’s the truth and that’s what happened. It sucks. But what you learn from it is that you only feel like you can die from embarrassment, you don’t actually die."" 
  
 And Hathaway has seemingly moved on from the criticism, going on to star in a handful of features such as Don Jon, The Intern, Alice Through the Looking Glass and most recently, Colossal, in which she plays a drunk drifter in what USA TODAY reporter Andrea Mandell called her ""riskiest post-Oscar move yet."" 
  
 The actress, who in March welcomed her son Jonathan with husband Adam Shulman, has also been enjoying being a newish mom. ""I’m feeding a child from my body, and that takes up all my time,"" she joked. 
  
 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eZYJcd ||||| In Colossal she plays a drunk drifter. Which will make good preparation for her Plan B in life … 
  
 Hi, Anne. Your weird new monster film, Colossal, sees you playing another drunk drifter. You got an Oscar nomination for a similar character in Rachel Getting Married. What is it about them that appeals? 
  
 I have met a lot of addicts in my life who I have a lot of tender affection for. I love when stories present the opportunity to take groups that have been stigmatised or judged and then show the human side. I always look at them and think, “That’s me in there,” on some level. 
  
 Some reviews have picked up on this theme of toxic masculinity, something that seems to be on the increase since Ghostbusters (1) . What do you think the film has to add to the debate? 
  
 I’m glad that you used the word “toxic”, because it’s very important to say that it’s very different from male energy. Male energy is beautiful. Male energy is welcome. Male energy is necessary. Male energy is half the reason why we’re here. That said, there has been a perversion of the beauty of male energy into this macho ideal that I don’t think services anybody. In the case of Ghostbusters, the thing that made me so sad about that experience was that people seemed to be blaming the girls for the men who chose to hit the film that they were in, and I didn’t think that was cool. In terms of my new movie, what our director was saying was that he thinks this energy really has no place in our world any more. 
  
 The movie jumps forward 25 years after its opening – so where do you see yourself in 25 years? 
  
 Underwater? No, I’m just going to be staring in awe at my son (2) . I’m a mum for the rest of my life. 
  
 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis and director Nacho Vigalondo discuss Colossal. 
  
 The film also feels like a response to the homogenised nature of blockbusters, taking the tropes we know and subverting them. Are you sick of seeing the same kind of film do well again and again, and would you say that Colossal is kind of a middle finger up to those blockbusters? 
  
 Wouldn’t that be great if I did? For you? 
  
 Can’t you just say that and I can use it as a quote? 
  
 Ha ha ha! No. But you’re right that things are not working in the way that people want them to and there’s a need to reassess. I don’t take it personally when bad movies get made. It takes so much work to make anything. I don’t know where it’s going to lead to, and I don’t know if this movie is going to have an impact. I’d like to think it might empower people to take risks (3) , but I don’t think we need to diminish one in order to celebrate the other. 
  
 What do you think about the new DC universe? Because it has not been as well-received as the one that you were involved in (4) … 
  
 I haven’t had a chance to see the films yet because I’m feeding a child from my body, and that takes up all my time, but I am aware of the reactions that various movies have had. I just think you gotta remember that no one sets out to make a bad movie and when people do, they’re aware of it. 
  
 You were surely aware of people’s reaction to your time in the spotlight during Oscar season when you won for Les Misérables (5) . How do you look back on that? 
  
 I felt very uncomfortable. I kind of lost my mind doing that movie and it hadn’t come back yet. Then I had to stand up in front of people and feel something I don’t feel which is uncomplicated happiness. It’s an obvious thing, you win an Oscar and you’re supposed to be happy. I didn’t feel that way. I felt wrong that I was standing there in a gown that cost more than some people are going to see in their lifetime (6) , and winning an award for portraying pain that still felt very much a part of our collective experience as human beings. I tried to pretend that I was happy and I got called out on it, big time. That’s the truth and that’s what happened. It sucks. But what you learn from it is that you only feel like you can die from embarrassment, you don’t actually die. 
  
 Did you ever have a plan B if this all didn’t work out? 
  
 I think I would probably have four unturned chairs on The Voice. No, I think I would be a professional drunk. Or I would be a really inspiring community leader. One or the other.

"Information:  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - Un mondo perfetto is the second studio album by Italian singer Dolcenera, released on May 18,  2005 via Amarena Music/BMG Ricordi. It peaked at #4 on the Italian album chart and spawned three  singles ""Mai più noi due"", ""Continua"" and ""Passo dopo passo"".  - Emanuela Trane (born 16 May 1977), better known by her stage name Dolcenera , is an Italian singer, songwriter and actress.  She rose to fame in 2003, after winning the newcomers' section of the Sanremo Music Festival, but she achieved commercial success in Italy only in 2005, when she won the music-based reality show ""Music Farm"" and she released her second album, ""Un mondo perfetto"". In 2005 she was also awarded Best New Artist of the Year at the Italian Meeting of Independent Record Labels and she received the De André Award for Best Emerging Artist.  - A stage name, also called a screen name, is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers such as actors, comedians, and musicians.  - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses.

The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.  - The Festival della canzone italiana di Sanremo (in English: ""Italian song festival of Sanremo"") is the most popular Italian song contest and awards, held annually in the city of Sanremo, in Italy, and consisting of a competition amongst previously unreleased songs. Usually referred to as Festival di Sanremo, or outside Italy as Sanremo Music Festival or Sanremo Music Festival Award, it was the inspiration for the Eurovision Song Contest.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented.

"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: What does the investigative journalist group ProPublica think about separating children from their parents? Options: - It disagrees with the policy - It is not interested in the policy - not enough information - It agrees with the policy

"Paragraph: American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a ""no radio"" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words ""we have some planes."" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.

"Q:Article: I don't have too many memories of my father because he was so sick in the last years of his life. But there aresome that I am often reminded of and which may have developed my love ofscience. When I was small, I was somewhatafraid of lightning and thunder . My father explained it. The explanation wasin words that a child could understand but was basically correct. I gained a betterunderstanding and learnt something from him. What he said was that there was electricity in the cloudsand it traveled to the ground like a spark . When it traveled through the air, it made the air so hot that it burned. Then there was nothing where the air had been and the air all around rushed in to fill the space. Saying this, he clapped his hands together very loudly, pretending to be the air rushing in, and said that makes the thunder. When I hear thunder, I can still hear that clap clearly. He also explained why a cloudy winter night was warmer than a clear one. When there were clouds, they were like blankets  which kept the earth and us warm. He said that if there were no clouds, we had no blankets and were _ to the universe. Our warmth was going toheat the whole universe.

"By. Becky Barrow. PUBLISHED:. 19:01 EST, 12 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:26 EST, 12 March 2013. Town and country: Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, says the children of families in rural areas don't have a God-given right to live near their parents. Children raised in the countryside have no automatic right to live near their parents’ homes when they grow up, the chairman of the National Trust declared yesterday. Sir Simon Jenkins said the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities, rather than in unspoilt rural areas. His comments are at odds with existing policies that encourage affordable housing to be built in villages for local families. Sir Simon said: ‘Somehow it is considered the right of people in the country to have their children living next door at public expense. I don’t understand it. ‘Are you going to say that people who have lived in the Windrush Valley [in the Cotswolds] for 100 years have a right to go on living there? No, I’m afraid they don’t. Sorry.’ Last night, some countryside groups attacked his comments, warning that villages without young families risked being turned into ‘little more than retirement ghettoes’. But Sir Simon, who owns homes in west London and rural Wales, even called for areas of the countryside to be listed to protect the most beautiful parts. He suggested introducing four different listed ‘grades’ of countryside – one of which could include a ‘presumption against development’. He said: ‘We should list the countryside as we list the town by virtue of its beauty.What it is that people want to retain. ‘We don’t want to pull down Belgravia. We don’t want to build housing estates in Hyde Park. We should adopt the same approach to the countryside.’ Picturesque: Sheepscome in the Cotswolds. Families who have lived in villages like this do not have a right to go on living there, says Sir Simon. He says the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities. Idyll: The village of Snowshill in the Cotswolds. Many countryside groups say there is an urgent need for affordable homes in rural areas. But opponents warned that house prices will rise even higher in rural areas if new homes are not built there. The row comes at a time when the average home in the countryside costs around £200,000 – around £30,000 more than a town house. Under threat? Castle Combe in Wiltshire. A minister said Britain faces a situation where home ownership is the right of a privileged few unless more homes are built. The. Windrush is a river in the Cotswolds, which flows through the famously. picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water as well as the Prime. Minister’s constituency town of Witney. Prices of homes near the Windrush can be eye-watering, with bungalows in Bourton-on-the-Water selling for up to £645,000 in recent months. But Sir Simon, who was speaking in a. personal capacity, told the Home Builders’ Federation conference in. central London: ‘I want building to take place in towns on the whole. I. want there to be massive incentives to build in towns because it makes. more sense.’ He said there. will be many parts of the countryside – ‘on the whole, rather lovely. parts of the countryside’ – that ‘just don’t want to take large numbers. of more people.’ He singled. out the Cotswolds village of Stow-on-the-Wold, where he said many. residents are ‘seriously angry’ at proposals to build a large number of. new homes. Last night his comments were attacked by those who said more affordable rural homes were needed. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders’ Federation, said: ‘We need to be providing homes across the country in places where people want to live. We should not be trying to just pigeon-hole people into living in towns where they might not want to live.’ Kate Houghton, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We do agree that the bulk of new housing should be built in or near to urban areas, so people have more easy access to public transport, community facilities and essential services. Sir Simon said protecting villages like Bisley from major housing developments and concentrating new homes in towns and cities 'makes sense' ‘However, if we don’t make provision. for at least some affordable houses in rural areas, where it is clear. that there is need and people do want to stay, then our villages could. become little more than retirement ghettoes or commuter dormitories.’ At the conference, Malcolm Harris, chairman of house builders Bovis, accused Sir Simon of being ‘quite naïve’. He. said: ‘These are your children. These are people who already live in. the community. We have failed for year after year after year to provide. the housing. That is a real issue in Great Britain.’ In England, around 110,000 new homes are. built ever year, but this is way behind the rate at which new. households are being formed, estimated to be around 230,000 a year. A spokesman for Priced Out, the first-time buyers’ campaign group, accused Sir Simon of being ‘out of touch with the aspirations of hard-working young adults who have been priced out of a home in their local area.’ Housing Minister Mark Prisk, who spoke at the same conference, said home ownership remains the dream of the vast majority of Britons. He told builders that the quality of the homes they build is just as important as the quantity, calling on them to reject the stereotype of the ‘rabbit hutch’. Sir Simon’s intervention comes weeks after Planning Minister Nick Boles warned Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home-ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless more homes are built. He said: ‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents. ‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

"Given the following passage  ""In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as ""Near East"", ""Far East"" and ""Middle East"" were relegated to the experts, especially in the new field of political science. The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs. Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past. This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations, now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense.

Swansea defender Williams, 31, collided heavily with team-mate Jonny Williams late on in the Euro 2016 last-16 1-0 win over Northern Ireland.
Substitute James Collins was ready to enter the game, but the Wales captain insisted he stayed on the field.
""We think it was when he fell and landed on his hand with a straight arm which had an impact on his shoulder,"" Coleman said. ""But he is okay.""
Coleman dismissed speculation the shoulder was dislocated.
""Ashley will be fine. It sounds better actually, that he would play with a dislocated shoulder - and he would if we let him. But it was not.

''It's probably a bit more sore today than yesterday because of the timing, 48 hours after the game. We will get him on the grass as soon as we can.
''I would not say he was a worry or a doubt, but we know we have to look after him. I would be surprised if he does not make the game.''
Williams had received hospital treatment on Saturday evening following the game in Paris
Having apparently recovered from the collision, Williams briefly sat down on the pitch as play continued, leading Coleman to ready a substitute.
Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill felt Wales deliberately made the most of Williams' situation.

"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Harry finds Chad, whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne, hiding in a wardrobe in the Coxes' home,...

"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene   meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive   weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. Question: How long does an American-style summer vacation last? Options: A: No more than two months. B: Less than three months. C: As long as three months. D: As long as four months.

When Sam Sheppard's boyfriend Ryan proposed to her it was, she says, more like 'being asked out for pizza'. So disappointing was this pivotal life moment that Sam decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again. So the 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question, founding The Proposal Expert, Wales' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service. On bended knee: Sam Sheppard, 34, right, launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend Ryan, left, offered her such a disappointing one. Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate. She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza. 'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out. 'At the time I thought it was because. he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I. realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.' You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question. She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.' Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose. The client can choose from a number. of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under. £100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every. aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and. vendors and handling payments. Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture. 'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.' Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt. Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens. Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it. 'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see. 'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.' Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package' Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple. Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert. She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick. 'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion. Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too' Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change. 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too. 'Everything the man says is what helps me to put the idea together - so whatever package they choose they still play a big part.' To hire Sam's services, visit www.theproposalexpert.co.uk.

"Please answer the following question: This article: The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production ""shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix"". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they ""couldn't top Reign in Blood"", and that whatever they recorded would be ""compared to that album"", he believed they ""had to slow down"", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to ""keep people guessing"" as another reason for the musical shift. ""In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole"", according to Slayer's official biography. ""They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.""King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his ""most lackluster"". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as ""probably the odd man out at that point"", he stated he ""didn't participate as much because of that"".  Hanneman said: ""We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell."" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and ""added too much singing"". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: ""There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

Title: Four Lions Movie plot: A group of radicalised young British Muslim men aspire to be suicide bombers. They are Omar (Riz Ahmed), who is deeply critical of Western society and imperialism; his dim-witted friend, Waj (Kayvan Novak); Barry (Nigel Lindsay), a bad-tempered and extremely rash white convert to Islam; and the naive Faisal (Adeel Akhtar), who tries to train crows to be used as bombers. While Omar and Waj go to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan (Arsher Ali). The visit to the training camp ends in disaster, with Omar misfiring a rocket backwards that kills fellow jihadists; however, he uses the experience to assert authority on his return to Britain. The group begins acquiring materials for making improvised explosive devices but disagree about what to target. Barry wants to bomb a local mosque as a false flag operation to ""radicalise the moderates"", but Omar considers this idiotic. Faisal suggests blowing up a branch of the pharmacy chain Boots, but Omar states it is a not a worthwhile target. Hassan allows an oblivious neighbour (Julia Davis) into their safe house; the group think they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal accidentally trips in a field while carrying the explosives and blows up. This causes a row among the remaining four, who disband; but they reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming London Marathon. Wearing mascot costumes to conceal their explosives, they prepare to attack. Waj expresses doubts about the rectitude of the plot, but Omar convinces him to go ahead. Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert nearby police officers, but Barry detonates his bomb using a mobile phone, killing Hassan. This causes the police to search for the remaining three.

""We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie."" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, ""The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive."" Its creators hope that ""The Simpsons Movie"" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, ""This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get."" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, ""When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof.

"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the only child of  Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns? ?  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, ""It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart."" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage ""Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such ""groups of permanent possibilities of sensation"" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of ""reality"" that goes beyond mere ""possibilities of sensation"", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the ""gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all"". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.""?

First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people.

"Background: Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali i Domenech, Marquis of Dali de Pubol (11 May 1904 - 23 January 1989), known professionally as Salvador Dali ( Catalan: [s@lb@'do d@'li]; Spanish: [salba'dor da'li]), was a prominent Spanish surrealist born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. Dali was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters.
Context: Dali employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, the hallmark ""melting watches"" that first appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed. The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dali when he was staring at a runny piece of Camembert cheese on a hot August day.  The elephant is also a recurring image in Dali's works. It appeared in his 1944 work Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening. The elephants, inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk, are portrayed ""with long, multijointed, almost invisible legs of desire"" along with obelisks on their backs. Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality. ""The elephant is a distortion in space"", one analysis explains, ""its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure."" ""I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly."" --Salvador Dali, in Dawn Ades, Dali and Surrealism.  The egg is another common Daliesque image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love; it appears in The Great Masturbator and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus. The Metamorphosis of Narcissus also symbolized death and petrification. There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at Dali's house in Port Lligat as well as at the Dali Theatre and Museum in Figueres.  Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear.  Both Dali and his father enjoyed eating sea urchins, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaques. The radial symmetry of the sea urchin fascinated Dali, and he adapted its form to many art works. Other foods also appear throughout his work.

"WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. ""We are not done yet,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. ""We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative."" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

"Born in Mumbai Genelia is an East Indian, a Marathi speaking Christian from North Konkan. She was raised in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai. Her mother Jeanette D'Souza was a managing director of the Pharma Multinational corporation. She left her job in 2004 to help Genelia with her career.

The year 2006 marked a significant turning point in Genelia's career. She completed two Telugu movies in early 2006, one was the romantic comedy Happy, and the other was Raam. She then portrayed the role of Haasini, a vibrant, effervescent and a happy-go-lucky young girl, in the 2006 Telugu romantic film Bommarillu. The movie, a blockbuster at the box-office, grossed Rs250 million (US$3.8 million) in India, and also won the 2006 Golden Nandi award. Her character was well received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, ""The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms. She does not overact and we just fall in love with her character. Genelia looks like a dream in chic skirts and is the life of the party and raises the bar of the film.""  Following the success of Bommarillu, Genelia played the role of the daughter of a local don, in the Tamil gangster film Chennai Kadhal alongside Boys co-star Bharath. Rediff.com criticized her commenting, ""Genelia stands up yet again to prove the point that if you are pretty and well dressed, you can get away with anything, without acting."" Shortly afterwards in 2007, Genelia played the role of sister of a notorious gangster in the blockbuster Telugu movie Dhee, set against a gang war backdrop.  The following year, Genelia appeared in the 2008 Telugu romantic thriller Mr. Medhavi, in which she portrayed the role of a student from Canada. The movie was successful, with Rediff.com complimenting her performance saying, ""Genelia is her effervescent self - full of joie-de-vivre and lights up the screen."" She made her Kannada debut in Satya in Love the same year. Later, she was cast in a leading role in Santhosh Subramaniam, a Tamil remake of Bommarillu. The film also turned out to be rather successful as its predecessor. Sify described Genelia's portrayal as ""the soul of the film"" and the film's ""biggest strength"", however Rediff.com described her character as ""appears a little too good to be true.""

Indianapolis would begin the second quarter with Stover's 33-yard field goal, yet the Niners came right back with Smith's 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis. Afterwards, the Colts would close out the half with Stover nailing a 31-yard field goal. Indianapolis would take the lead in the third quarter as Stover nailed a 40-yard field goal, followed by running back Joseph Addai's 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne to begin the fourth quarter (with a failed 2-point conversion). San Francisco tried to rally, but the Colts' defense would shut down any possible comeback attempt.

Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887 - 14 February 1975) was a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association. Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television.

As the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning.  In the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks, which was happening in the few areas that remained uninhabited due to malaria. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's Africa Survey.  In 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said ""He was impatient... and lacked tact"". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.  In 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society--""a curious assemblage... of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic""--uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post ""to save expenses"". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the Council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way.  In 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The pan should be able to take about 1.5 liters (2 3/4 pints) of water, or 10cm (4"") depth of water. The fresher an egg is, the better it will poach because its white is thicker. Use eggs that are as fresh as possible; an egg straight from the chicken will poach without any need for vinegar as it will coagulate immediately. into a ramekin, small bowl or soup ladle. Do this gently so as not to harm the appearance of the egg. Alternatively, crack the egg onto a small, flat plate as this makes sliding the egg into the pan of water easier. Don't break the yolk when cracking the egg. Given the possibility of breaking the egg when moving it from a bowl or plate to the pan, some people prefer to skip this step and break the egg straight into the water. If you do this, be careful and only add one at a time. And note that by cracking the eggs separately into a cup and not straight into the water, the cracked eggs have the chance to set back up into their little ""protein cocoon"". You might like to experiment to work out what works best for you. The water should be barely simmering and the temperature about 160-180ºF (71-82ºC). Make sure that you do not drop the egg into boiling water (100ºC/212ºF), as this will toughen the eggs and make them unpalatable. Poached eggs should be served as soon as they're removed from the water and drained. They cool down quickly and once cold, they're not as desirable for the diner.  Serve on thick slices of crusty toast. Serve with baked beans, a cooked tomato and sausages. Serve with a salad. Serve inside a pita bread pocket. Serve on vegetables. Serve the poached eggs over toasted buttered English muffins and topped with Bearnaise or Hollandaise sauce, maybe a little bacon or grilled ham on the side. Serve as eggs Benedict.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

"Article:

Believe it or not, up until 2016, a real life sanitary pad had never been seen in an advert before. This is despite the fact they're a product some women use every single month. SHIELD YOUR EYES, LADIES. DON'T STARE AT IT DIRECTLY. 
  
 Of course, Bodyform changed all that with their revolutionary advert - and here we are again, one year later, when they're challenging an entirely different taboo: period blood itself. And they're tackling it head on, by featuring it twice in their latest advert. Take a look, it's pretty cool: 
  
 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 
  
 Bodyform has long known that periods shouldn't be something women - or men, for that matter - should shy away from discussing. They're just another part of ordinary life. So now they're working on reminding the rest of the world of that with their #bloodnormal campaign. And where better to start than with mainstream advertising? 
  
 The groundbreaking ad depicts period blood in two different forms. Firstly, with a realistic red liquid being poured from a test-tube onto a pad to demonstrate absorbency, instead of the usual blue liquid we see. Secondly, we see period blood running down a woman's leg while she's showering, alongside scenes of a man very casually popping into a shop to buy a pack of pads. And here's the best bit: he's not squeamishly hiding them underneath a bundle of lads mags in an attempt to remind the shopkeeper of his masculinity. He's just... buying them.

 The advert features scenes of period blood running down a woman’s leg in the shower. YouTube Bodyform 
  
 The advert follows research carried out by the sanitary-wear brand which indicated that one in five women felt their confidence had been damaged because periods weren’t discussed openly. 
  
 ""We know that the 'period taboo' is damaging,"" said Traci Baxter, marketing manager at Bodyform. ""It means people are more likely to struggle with the effects of period poverty, whilst others struggle with their mental health and wellbeing. As a leader in feminine hygiene, we want to change this by challenging the taboo and ultimately removing the stigma, making it even easier for anyone to talk about periods, now and in the future."" 
  
 Good job, you guys. 
  
 Follow Cat on Instagram. ||||| Bodyform is tackling period taboo by depicting menstrual blood in their new advert. 
  
 In a UK first, the 20-second clip will depict a hand pouring a vial of realistic-looking blood onto a sanitary towel, followed by shots of a woman in the shower with droplets of blood on her legs. 
  
 The thought-provoking Blood Normal campaign marks a first in feminine care, by using realistic red liquid instead of infamous blue liquid in their ad. 
  
 Bodyform’s provocative campaign aims to normalise menstruation by representing it in a series of true-to-life scenarios. 
  
 The ad also shows a man buying sanitary towels, presumably on behalf of a woman in his life; and a woman relaxing on a pool float before flashing the tagline: “Periods are normal. Showing them should be too.” 
  
 It’s a progressive move in feminine hygiene advertising, with 61 per cent of women citing the majority of campaigns as unrealistic, a OnePulse survey found. 
  
 Blood Normal addresses the lack of realistic representation of periods in mainstream culture and Bodyform hope that their ad will shatter some of the stigma attached to menstruation. 
  
 The ad follows findings unveiled in their “Period Taboo” survey, which revealed that one in five women had suffered knocks to their confidence as a result of periods not being discussed openly with them. 
  
 “We were so shocked by the results of our research that we publicly vowed to address the continued silence around periods,” said Traci Baxter, marketing manager at Bodyform. 
  
 “We believe that like any other taboo, the more people see it, the more normal the subject becomes. So for Bodyform, after showing blood and a real, in-situ sanitary towel, bringing the two together was a natural next step. In doing so, we remain committed to showing periods in everyday life, truthfully and honestly – because we feel it’s the right thing to do to. Together, we can help make blood normal.” ||||| Image copyright Bodyform Image caption Bodyform's advertising campaign also shows a man buying sanitary towels 
  
 Bodyform has become the first brand in the UK to feature sanitary pads stained with red liquid, rather than blue, in its adverts. 
  
 Parent company Essity said it wanted to confront taboos surrounding periods. 
  
 The firm says research found 74% of people wanted to see more honest representation in adverts. 
  
 Bodyform's video campaign, #bloodnormal, shows a woman in the shower with blood running down her thigh and a man buying sanitary towels. 
  
 It follows a 2016 advert where sportswomen were shown muddy and bloodied while doing activities like bike riding, boxing and running. 
  
 With the slogan ""no blood should hold us back"", it featured a sanitary towel on a TV advert for the first time. 
  
 Image copyright Bodyform Image caption The new advert features a woman in the shower 
  
 Sanitary brands and adverts have traditionally opted to use blue liquid in order to represent how much moisture their pads can hold. 
  
 The new campaign has been mostly well received.

Question: Dr. Paula Olsen works with what kind of children? Movie title: Nell Movie plot: When stroke victim Violet Kellty dies in her isolated cabin in the North Carolina mountains, Dr. Jerome ""Jerry"" Lovell, the town doctor, finds a terrified young woman hiding in the house rafters. She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own. Looking at Violet's Bible, Jerry finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after Violet's daughter Nell. Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping that Nell was conceived through rape. Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher working with autistic children. Paula and her colleague Dr. Alexander ""Al"" Paley are interested in studying a ""wild child"" (feral child), and Al continues calling Nell this even after studying films showing that Nell does not fit the ""wild child"" profile. Paula and Al get a court order to institutionalize Nell for further study. Jerry hires lawyer Don Fontana and prevents it. The judge gives Jerry and Paula three months to interact with Nell and see what her needs are. Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell's behavior while Jerry chooses to stay in Nell's cabin and quietly observe. Paula discovers that Nell's seemingly indecipherable language is English, based partly on her mother's aphasic speech after a stroke, and partly on the secret language she shared with her decades deceased identical twin sister. Jerry and Paula begin a grudging friendship. Nell sleeps during the day or works inside her home and is active outdoors only after sunset. She explains to Jerry that her mother told her about the rape and warned her that men were evildoers. As Nell comes to trust Jerry, she sees him as a friend, the ""gah'inja"" her mother promised would come. Jerry later realizes that ""gah'inja"" is Nell's phrase for ""guardian angel."" Using popcorn as an incentive, Jerry is able to lead Nell outside and into the sun. Nell leads Jerry and Paula to the decayed remains of her identical twin sister, May, who died in a fall while the two were playing in the woods. Mike Ibarra, a reporter,...

"Article:
Former IU basketball player Todd Jadlow said he wished someone would have told him he would spend 20 months in a 20-by-20-foot cell, lose his possessions and custody of his 2-year-old daughter and sit shaking with a revolver in his mouth. 
  
 That’s what he told more than 100 students Monday night in Rawles Hall. They had never seen him make a layup in Assembly Hall. 
  
 “Seems like yesterday I was running in and out of the Lambda Chi house,” Jadlow said. “I kind of know what you’re going through and what you’re dealing with here.” 
  
 Jadlow was there to speak about his path from drug and alcohol abuse to the head of a recovery foundation. 
  
 “We’re doing this to raise awareness of the various pathways to recovery,” OASIS Director Jackie Daniels said. “And his was pretty bumpy.” 
  
 Daniels reached out to Jadlow when Sam Storey, a junior in Delta Tau Delta fraternity, contacted her about hosting a program with Delta Delta Delta sorority. 
  
 Storey and Josh Piper, the chapter president, said they were glad Daniels presented the opportunity to hear a Hoosier tell his story, especially in Rawles Hall where students in and out of the greek community could attend. 
  
 They were also glad to join the Tri Delts in raising money for the Todd Jadlow Give It Back Foundation, which helps people get into rehab centers and sober housing. 
  
 The program coincided well with National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week, Daniels said, and it relates to OASIS’s relatively new group Students in Recovery. 
  
 But for Daniels, there was a personal element. When she was 9, IU won the NCAA championship. 
  
 “And Todd was on the winning team,” Daniels said. “So he was kind of part of my childhood growing up here in Bloomington.” 
  
 Growing up in Salina, Kansas, Jadlow was teased incessantly. People told him he would never be athletic or smart enough to succeed in college. 
  
 “At 14, I had my first taste of alcohol,” Jadlow said. “And I thought that was the answer.” 
  
 Four rough years later, he walked onto the IU campus for the first time. His life became submerged in IU basketball. He said he and his teammates were treated like gods. 
  
 Jadlow said basketball was his savior because he couldn’t risk using substances and losing his scholarships. 
  
 Looking out over the audience, he recalled driving by the Jackson Heights Apartments just before coming to speak to the group. As always, he had to blow into his car’s breathalyzer every half hour. 
  
 Jadlow recounted how, just after graduating and as he prepared for the NBA draft, a teammate invited him to that same apartment complex. The teammate offered Jadlow his first line of cocaine. 
  
 “Show me your friends, and I will show you your future,” Jadlow said to the room of fraternity brothers and sorority sisters. 
  
 In that apartment, Jadlow promised himself the cocaine would be a one-time thing. In years to come, he would play countless professional basketball games. 
  
 And that one line of cocaine would transform into a prize after every win — and every loss. 
  
 Jadlow promised himself the drugs and alcohol would stop once he finished playing. 
  
 Yet his addiction followed as he moved from basketball into orthopedic surgery. He would earn four DUIs in six months, two in one December 2013 day. 
  
 Thinking back to his college days, Jadlow asked why, when the weekend hits, students can’t be themselves. 
  
 “If you think it can’t happen to you, you better take the steps to make sure it doesn’t happen to you,” he said. 
  
 Once Jadlow finished talking and most of the lecture hall cleared, members of the greek community and Students in Recovery chatted with him. 
  
 Harrison Campbell, a senior Lambda Chi Alpha brother and recovering student, said he walked through the door that night to represent the hard work of Students in Recovery. 
  
 He walked out the door with Jadlow, now sober, and showed him the Lambda Chi house where he sometimes parties, now sober.

 Todd Jadlow, a former Indiana Hoosiers player on Bobby Knight’s 1987 championship team, co-authored an autobiography with Tom Brew titled Jadlow: On The Rebound, which was released Oct. 15. According to Bob Kravitz of WTHR, Jadlow’s book contains allegations of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse against Knight. 
  
 Advertisement 
  
 Jadlow states that he did not include every nefarious coaching method employed by Knight in his book; what he did include is a laundry list of transgressions depicting a bully of a head coach, nearly all of which would be grounds for firing. The former player alleges that throughout his four years in the program from 1985-89, Knight punched him in the back of the head, broke a clipboard over his head, called teammate Daryl Thomas a “pussy” and told a manager to line his dorm room with pictures of vaginas, and habitually grabbed and squeezed his and other players’ testicles. 
  
 The list of included allegations, via WTHR: 
  
 That Knight punched him in the back of the head with a closed fist during a walkthrough for an NCAA Tournament game against Seton Hall. 
  
  
  
 That inside a sideline huddle during a 1989 game against Louisville – the game when Sports Illustrated famously captured a photo of the coach pushing Jadlow back onto the court — Knight cracked a clipboard over Jadlow’s head. 
  
  
  
 That after an NIT game in New York City, an enraged Knight once dug his hands so deeply into Jadlow’s sides, he left bruises. Jadlow includes a picture of the bruises Knight left; “It’s weird because I never carried a camera,” he was telling me Friday over a Stromboli at Nick’s. “But I had this thought, ‘You know, if I ever write a book about my experiences, I want to have a picture of what he did to me.’” 
  
  
  
 That Knight made a habit, with Jadlow and others, of grabbing players by the testicles and squeezing. 
  
  
  
 That Knight continually called Daryl Thomas a “(bleeping) p——-” and once instructed the managers to wallpaper Thomas’ locker with pictures of female genitalia. Knight also liked to throw tampons at Thomas, who took more abuse than anybody on Jadlow’s teams. 
  
  
  
 That on the flight home after the 1986 NCAA Tournament loss to Cleveland State, Knight tore up the plane and ultimately grabbed Thomas by the neck and shook him violently. 
  
  
  
 That Knight made sport of Jadlow’s facial tic in front of the entire team; in the book, former IU teammate Mark Robinson wrote that Knight yelled at Jadlow, “If you don’t stop the (bleeping) twitching, I’m going to throw your ass out of here.” 
  
  
  
 That during a practice, Knight forced Dean Garrett and Keith Smart to run hours of sprints while barking like dogs since they were, in his words, “playing like (bleeping) dogs.” 
  
  
  
 While some of the allegations of abuse are being told for the first time, Jadlow does not appear to be a jaded former player with an axe to grind—in speaking with Kravitz, he referred to himself as “a Knight guy” even still, saying that he loves the coach “like a father” and skipped his 1984 team’s Indiana-run 2011 reunion out of loyalty to Knight. (Knight was fired in 2000 after a CNN/Sports Illustrated report revealed he choked a player named Neil Reed in 1997.) Jadlow told Kravitz he reached out multiple times to speak with Knight while he was writing about the allegations for the book but was rebuffed by Knight’s camp.

 Jadlow’s book deals largely with his life struggles, namely his battle with drug addiction and depression, and his ongoing journey back to a healthy state of mind; he spoke with Indiana undergraduate students about his book and personal experiences at an event Monday. 
  
 [WTHR] ||||| BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (WTHR) — Most of Todd Jadlow's new book, ""Jadlow: On The Rebound,"" is about the former IU basketball player's horrifying and ultimately redemptive journey, about his headlong descent into a life of drugs, alcohol and finally incarceration. It shares, in stark and shocking detail, how far the former Hoosier fell, losing everything including his freedom, how his downward spiral had him thinking about suicide and praying every night that he wouldn't wake up the next morning. 
  
 That's not the headline, though, in the recently-released book he co-wrote with former Indianapolis journalist Tom Brew. 
  
 This is the headline: Jadlow alleges that former IU basketball coach Bob Knight physically and emotionally abused him and other players. 
  
 He alleges: 
  
 That Knight punched him in the back of the head with a closed fist during a walkthrough for an NCAA Tournament game against Seton Hall. 
  
 That inside a sideline huddle during a 1989 game against Louisville – the game when Sports Illustrated famously captured a photo of the coach pushing Jadlow back onto the court -- Knight cracked a clipboard over Jadlow's head. 
  
 That after an NIT game in New York City, an enraged Knight once dug his hands so deeply into Jadlow's sides, he left bruises. Jadlow includes a picture of the bruises Knight left; ""It's weird because I never carried a camera,"" he was telling me Friday over a Stromboli at Nick's. ""But I had this thought, 'You know, if I ever write a book about my experiences, I want to have a picture of what he did to me.' "" 
  
 That Knight made a habit, with Jadlow and others, of grabbing players by the testicles and squeezing. 
  
 That Knight continually called Daryl Thomas a ""(bleeping) p-----"" and once instructed the managers to wallpaper Thomas' locker with pictures of female genitalia. Knight also liked to throw tampons at Thomas, who took more abuse than anybody on Jadlow's teams. 
  
 That on the flight home after the 1986 NCAA Tournament loss to Cleveland State, Knight tore up the plane and ultimately grabbed Thomas by the neck and shook him violently. 
  
 That Knight made sport of Jadlow's facial tic in front of the entire team; in the book, former IU teammate Mark Robinson wrote that Knight yelled at Jadlow, ""If you don't stop the (bleeping) twitching, I'm going to throw your ass out of here."" 
  
 That during a practice, Knight forced Dean Garrett and Keith Smart to run hours of sprints while barking like dogs since they were, in his words, ""playing like (bleeping) dogs."" 
  
 And that, Jadlow said recently, was just a partial accounting of Knight's excesses. 
  
 ""If he did those things today,"" Jadlow said, ""he (Knight) would be in jail."" 
  
 “I wanted to be honest about all of it, my time at Indiana, everything” 
  
 Now, sitting here at Nick's with his daughter, Adriana, and a reporter, Jadlow knows there's going to be significant backlash. The Knight true believers will not accept Jadlow's version of events, or they will demean him as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who is merely telling lies in order to sell a book. They will criticize him for lifting the curtain on Knight and life inside the IU program. He knows all of this. And he's ready. 
  
 ""It's definitely going to be interesting,"" he said. ""But the reason for this book was to be completely honest and transparent. I wanted to tell the whole story of my life, tell people all the worst things I've done in my life and how I've hurt people, especially the ones I love. I wanted to be honest about all of it, my time at Indiana, everything."" 
  
 And yet, he still reveres Knight. After all of that, he still sees Knight as a father figure. It's complicated, to say the least. 
  
 ""I'm a Knight guy, I'm proud to have played for him and love him like a father; let's not mistake that,"" Jadlow said. ""But this was the life we led when we were playing for him."" 
  
 ""A lot of who he is, I took a lot from. Right or wrong, I took a lot from him. Some aren't good, like holding resentments, like if you've done me wrong once, I'm done with you. That's not right. Loyalty? You can be loyal to a fault. It's misguided, like me not coming back to the (1987) championship reunion (in 2011) out of loyalty to Coach Knight. In hindsight, I deeply regret that decision."" 
  
 During the writing of the book, Jadlow and Brew attempted to reach out to Knight to give him the opportunity to respond, but they were told by an intermediary that he was not interested. WTHR also called and e-mailed a Knight confidante to offer a chance to share his side of the story. We were told that Knight would not be offering a response. 
  
 Again, though, the Knight material is the headline, the stuff that will end up making national news. The greater story, the one Jadlow hopes won't get lost in the Knight conversation, is the one about his decline into alcoholism, drug addiction and incarceration. 
  
 This is the CliffsNotes version of that story.

 ""You know what I remember?"" she said, speaking to her father. ""The plate. Dad, remember that plate with the big chip in it that was always around the house? I never knew what was on that plate; I thought maybe it was flour or something. I had no idea. But then one day, I figured out that it was cocaine and a straw. I remember going near it one time to look at it, and you went crazy telling me to leave it alone. That's when it all started to make sense to me."" 
  
 Todd looked up from his food and looked horrified, mortified. What have I done to my children? 
  
 Jadlow was a relatively straight laced kid growing up in Salina, Kansas. But he didn't live in a happy home, where he said his parents, his teachers, everybody told him he'd never amount to much of anything. He was also hazed and bullied unmercifully, largely because of a facial tic that had him wondering if he was suffering from Tourette's Syndrome. 
  
 He tried alcohol once when he was 14 – ""It made the pain go away,"" he said – and he tried marijuana once, although the latter did nothing for him. While at IU, he largely behaved himself, in great part because Knight had no tolerance for that sort of thing. 
  
 But after his senior year, he was preparing for the NBA Draft when a teammate at the time called him. ""Come by my apartment,"" he told Jadlow. ""I've got something for you."" 
  
 In fact, while driving to Bloomington North High School Friday morning to speak to a class, Jadlow stopped by that old teammate's apartment and pointed it out to Adriana. ""That's where it all began,"" he told her. 
  
 “I felt like I could jump out of the gym” 
  
 Jadlow saw the cocaine, a drug he'd never seen before, then told himself, ""This is going to be a one-time thing. Just once. Never again."" So he snorted a line. He snorted more lines. He loved the euphoria, the sense of invincibility, the way the pain seemed to dissipate. Later that night, he walked to Assembly Hall, where he had a key to the building and the bank of lights, then started shooting hoops with a fraternity buddy. ""I felt like I could jump out of the gym,"" Jadlow said. 
  
 ""Man, I liked it. Something about the euphoria. It was 'Todd's secret.' A walk on the wild side, and that fascinated me. It enticed me and drew me in."" 
  
 Now, talking to the high school students this past Friday, Jadlow was illustrating how that one-time-thing became his life – and his ultimate downfall: 
  
 ""I wish they would have told me then that after that first drink or first line of cocaine that I would end up being humiliated and shamed, that I would lose my kids, that I would be incarcerated and labeled by a judge as being a risk to society,"" he said. ""I wish that they had told me that I would have my house taken, my cars taken, my clothes, everything. I wish they had told me that I was going to take a revolver and put it in my mouth and I was going to sit there shaking and contemplating whether to pull the trigger. I wish they would have told me that all I'd want to do was die."" 
  
 Jadlow went on to play professionally overseas for 12 years, and despite his lifestyle, he had plenty of personal and team success. But the drinking was worsening. The cocaine use was completely out of control. ""It got to the point where I cared more about the party afterwards than I did the actual game,"" Jadlow said. ""Cocaine was my prize. How crazy is that?"" 
  
 During his time playing basketball in Argentina, he befriended a man who happened to be a general in the Bolivian cocaine cartel. 
  
 ""At one time, I had 20 kilos in my apartment, 20 bricks of coke,"" he said. ""That scared me. It was the first time I ever thought that I'm in over my head. This guy starts telling me stories, tells me, 'If you need anybody taken care of, don't worry, we'll take care of it.' I'm thinking, 'What am I doing? This is total lunacy.'"" 
  
 It didn't diminish his taste for the drug, or for alcohol, or for the lifestyle that he had created. By 2013, he was completely out of control, then finally hit rock bottom. 
  
 Jadlow was busted four times in six months for driving under the influence. Four times in six months. Two of those DUI's came the very same day. The second one of the day came with Jadlow driving 121 miles per hour drunk and high with his then-2 year old in the backseat. 
  
 ""The judge told me if I'd gotten four DUI's in six months, it meant I'd probably driven drunk 4000 times,"" Jadlow said. ""But my luck ran out and it was time to pay."" 
  
 With alcoholics and addicts, it's not just the alcoholics and addicts who suffer. Jadlow has five children, and they suffered. 
  
 ""I lived with my dad my sophomore year of high school,"" Adriana said. ""I didn't understand what was happening, why he was starting to take things out on me, why he would say, 'I want to kill myself.' I was oblivious to the fact he was drinking until it got really bad and I moved out. After that, I hated him, didn't want to talk to him, wanted nothing to do with him. Then Dec. 11, 2013, the day he got arrested, I had just finished a big rivalry basketball game, and I looked at my phone and saw all these messages. 'Are you related to Todd Jadlow? Is Todd Jadlow your dad?' And then one of my best friends sent me a picture of him on the news with him being arrested."" 
  
 It still kills Jadlow that on senior night, all the parents accompanied their daughters on the court to be celebrated. All the parents, except one. Jadlow was in jail. Even recounting it now, in front of the Bloomington North students, his voice cracks with emotion. 
  
 Remember that 2-year old who was in the back seat when Jadlow was popped for going 121 miles per hour while intoxicated? 
  
 “How could you abandon me like that?” 
  
 ""I didn't see her for 15 months, and then I'll never forget this, I finally got to see her under a supervised setting,"" Jadlow said. ""As my daughter walked in, she hid behind the lady who was proctoring the visit and I heard her say, 'No Dad, no Dad.' She didn't even want to see me. I could see this look in her eyes -- 'What did you do? How could you abandon me like that?'"" 
  
 Even still, it took Jadlow time to look in the mirror and see who he had truly become. For months, he denied that he had a significant problem that was going to someday kill him and cause more pain for his family. He was still Todd Jadlow, the pro basketball player – not one of these losers who end up behind bars. 
  
 Over time, though, he began to see the light. 
  
 ""I'll never forget sitting in jail and I got down on my knees,"" he said. ""I grew up in a Catholic family, but somewhere I lost my way, lost my higher power. I said, 'God, either show me a better way to live or take me the hell out of here.' At almost the same time, I got a letter from Adriana, saying, 'God never gives his soldiers battles that they can't handle; he saves his toughest battles for his warriors.' That's when I started my relationship back with Christ, and started to understand what I'd done and the damage I had caused. And I knew there was a way to recover."" 
  
 Jadlow did a year in jail, then spent three months in a work-release program and three months in a halfway house, all while being under probation. He said he has been sober for three years, and now wants to dedicate all his time and efforts to speaking to groups, to schools especially, all in the hope that those kids don't make the same mistakes he did. 
  
 And yes, there's something selfish about that undertaking, too, which he acknowledges. 
  
 ""It's very therapeutic for me to tell my story,"" he said. ""I get as much out of it as they do. Talking about it keeps me on the right path. If I'm going to talk the talk, I've got to walk the walk. I don't want to be a hypocrite or a fraud. 
  
 ""I hate the word relapse, man, hate it. In my mind, I still have that thought that there's nothing I can't do if I just put my mind to it. They say that on average, it takes seven rehabs before you actually get sober. But I'm not going to do it (relapse). I know how one decision to do one thing will lead to the next and the next and the next, and next thing I'll be right back to where I was and I'll lose everything."" 
  
 He smiled. It was a peaceful smile. 
  
 ""I'm never going back to that place."" |||||Summary:",0,0,0,1,0,0
"History of India
The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centered on Kannauj that lasted for more than two centuries between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire, and Gurjara Pratihara Empire. Southern India was ruled by the Chalukya, Chola, Pallava, Chera, Pandyan, and Western Chalukya Empires. The seventh century also saw the advent of Islam as a political power, though as a fringe, in the western part of the subcontinent, in modern-day Pakistan. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India and successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bengal in the 11th century. The early medieval period Indian mathematics influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world and the Hindu numerals were introduced.

Meanwhile, killings have been happening to random people and the number one suspects are the Kardashians. Becca is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol) but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna.Later, Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in its path without any harm to himself or Becca (the other student is very badly injured). He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood, and shows her the shiny bling he wears under his clothes. The pair fall in love, and he introduces Becca to his vampire family on her birthday. While unwrapping a gift, Becca gets a paper cut, causing Edward's family to go into a blood frenzy and try to kill her before Edward fights them off. Realizing the danger that he and his family pose to Becca, Edward ends their relationship while saving her from the one of the three nomadic vampires who have been killing humans, Jack (Charlie Weber), by knocking his head off with a baseball bat. Jack's head flies through Sheriff Frank's car window, and he blames the Kardashians.Edward's departure leaves Becca heartbroken for months (and screaming for hours), and she discovers that thrill-seeking activities and attempted suicides evoke Edward's preserved image.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesse's Brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) also arrives,... My question: What is the store that Edy travels to called?

Question: What does Audrey II demand more of from Seymour? Movie plot title: Little Shop of Horrors Movie plot: Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) and his colleague, Audrey (Ellen Greene), work at Mushnik's Flower Shop, lamenting they cannot escape the slums of New York City, living in a run-down, rough neighborhood referred to as ""Skid Row."" Struggling from a lack of customers, Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) prompts to close the store, only for Audrey to suggest displaying an unusual plant Seymour owns. Immediately attracting a customer, Seymour explains he bought the plant, which he dubbed ""Audrey II"", from a Chinese flower shop during a solar eclipse. Attracting business to Mushnik's shop, the plant soon starts dying, worrying Seymour. Accidentally pricking his finger, he then discovers Audrey II needs human blood to thrive. Audrey II continues to grow rapidly and Seymour becomes a local celebrity. Seymour soon attempts to ask Audrey out, but she turns him down because she has a date with her sadistic, mean-spirited dentist boyfriend Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin). Despite this, Audrey is interested in Seymour, as well as dreams of marrying him and escaping Skid Row. After Seymour closes up shop, Audrey II (Levi Stubbs) begins to talk to Seymour, demanding more blood than Seymour can give.

"If you've never made brake lines before, you'll need to do some research to ensure you're installing the correct parts. Look in the owners manual, or bring the old brakes lines off your car and into an automobile shop. Head to the local auto shop and grab the parts necessary for your overhaul. You should be using the old parts as a guideline for the lengths and sizes, as all cars will have slightly different specifications.  Don't forget to purchase the appropriate brake fluid as well. You'll need to fill it later. Again, when in doubt, do some research. The internet is filled with specific advice for each make, model, and even year of the car. As long as you have the right sizes and fittings, you can buy brake lines that are already double flared. Make sure, however, that the pre-flared line will fit your car by comparing to the old lines. These devices are relatively inexpensive, and will quickly pay for themselves if you're flaring multiple lines. They come in three basic varieties:   Manual: The cheapest, most basic option (usually under $100), these are perfect for most non-professional mechanics and hobbyists. Can even be borrowed or rented from many auto stores.  Leverage Manual: Like manual, but require less time and force for each flair. If you restore vehicles frequently or want a complete overhaul of your lines, this may be worth the extra money. Usually several hundred dollars.  Hydraulic: Makes quick, even flares, but is likely overkill unless your making multiple flare lines a day or need to save time (like an auto-mechanic might). Can get very expensive. You need to make clean, quick cuts in the brake tubing or else your lines will be weak and prone to leaks. Tubing cutters clamp to the tube and then rotate around the tube with a small knife, slowly cutting in a circular motion instead of pushing down to cut, which could pinch the tubing. They are usually less than $30. In a pinch, you can use a hacksaw. If so, however, use only light pressure, focusing on cutting side-to-side instead of up and down.

In the second quarter, the only scores were a 44-yard field goal by Nick Folk for Dallas and a 24-yard field by Jeff Reed for Pittsburgh. The teams went into halftime tied at 3. In the 3rd, Tony Romo found Terrell Owens for a 12-yard touchdown pass that broke the tie. Then, a 33-yard field goal by Nick Folk sent the Cowboys into the 4th quarter with a 13-3 lead. Midway through the 4th, Jeff Reed connected on a 41-yard field goal to cut the Cowboys' lead to 13-6. Then, Ben Roethlisberger and Tight End Heath Miller hooked up for a 6-yard Steelers touchdown that tied the game at 13. On the ensuing Dallas possession, Tony Romo was intercepted by Deshea Townsend who returned it 25 yards for a touchdown, and Pittsburgh led 20-13. After the kickoff, the Cowboys failed to convert on a 4th-and-10 and the Steelers got the ball back. They were then able to run the clock out and seal the victory.

"Now, I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to go down that path here.

But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...

But there was one consistent point that I couldn't help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity.

Movie title: Chain Lightning Context: Lt. Colonel Matt Brennan (Humphrey Bogart), discharged from the military, runs a civilian flying school, where he is reunited with an old US Army Air Force buddy, Major Hinkle (James Brown). Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot. Another connection to his past is his former flame, Jo Holloway (Eleanor Parker), now Willis' secretary. In order to prove the capabilities of the new JA-3, capable of speeds up to 1,400Â mph (2,300Â km/h), Brennan convinces Willis that a record-breaking flight from Nome, Alaska to Washington D.C., via the North Pole, will impress the government. At the same time, Troxell tries to develop a safer version of the revolutionary aircraft, the JA-4, equipped with an escape pod, but dies during a test flight. The earlier record flight is a success with Brennan earning a $30,000 paycheck, enough to marry Jo. Then he learns that Troxell has been killed. Despite his earlier reservations about the need for safety systems, Brennan takes another JA-4 out for the official government demonstrations, using the escape pod to prove that the new aircraft is safe. On landing, he falls into the arms of his beloved.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. ""Jerusalem,"" he mumbled. ""Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters."" Then he panted heavily. ""Hush, sire,"" she whispered. ""Rest easy.""

The wolf is the vampire Maximilian [Eddie Murphy], the sole survivor of the massacre of a tribe of vampires living on an island in the Bermuda Triangle. Max has come to Brooklyn to find Rita Veder [Angela Bassett], the half-vampire daughter born to a human and a vampire from his tribe.Meanwhile, Julius Jones [Kadeem Hardison] isn't having a good night. First, there was that ship that ran aground and plowed right through the building where he and Silas Green [John Witherspoon] were working. Then his woman kicked him out of the house for snoring while otherwise engaged. Now, two thugs are after him for his money or his blood. Then, just as Julius is about to meet his maker, the vampire Maximilian shows up, neatly kills off the two thugs, and informs Julius that he is to become his renfield and that the first thing he must do is retrieve Max's coffin from the ship.Ship and dock are crawling with the law, one of whom is Detective Rita Veder. Rita and her partner Justice [Allen Payne] have been sent to investigate the accident in the harbor and the 18 bodies aboard that were found drained of blood. While checking out the ship, Rita falls through a rotten floorboard and lands in the cargohold where she finds a coffin and gets a glimpse of Max, who recognizes her immediately. Rita chases him, but he disappears. When she returns to the cargohold, the coffin is gone, a human ear remaining in its place. Max and Julius take the coffin to Julius's house, an apartment he rents from Silas.The ship's log is retrieved, but it is written in some obscure language that no one at the university can decipher, so it is sent to Dr Zeko for translation. Zeko's turns out to be a nightclub, but Zeko [Zakes Mokae] is able to tell that the log speaks about a nosferatu on board. As Rita sits at a table, waiting for Justice to return from a phone call, she doesn't notice that a cobra in a nearby terrarium has escaped and...

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - ""Time (Clock of the Heart)"" is a song by the British new wave band Culture Club, released as a stand-alone single in most of the world and as the second single from their debut album ""Kissing to Be Clever"" in North America. Following on the heels of the band's global #1, ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"", ""Time (Clock of the Heart)"" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 500,000 copies in the UK. In the United States, the song matched the #2 peak of its predecessor on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100, kept from #1 by ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" by Irene Cara for 2 weeks.  - George Alan O'Dowd (born 14 June 1961), known professionally as Boy George, is an English singer, songwriter, DJ, fashion designer and photographer. He is the lead singer of the Grammy and Brit Award-winning pop band Culture Club. At the height of the band's fame, during the 1980s, they recorded global hit songs such as ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"", ""Time (Clock of the Heart)"" and ""Karma Chameleon"" and George is known for his soulful voice and androgynous appearance. He was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s to the early 1980s.  - Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'.   - ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"" is a song written and recorded by the British new wave band Culture Club. Released as a single in September 1982 from the group's platinum-selling debut album ""Kissing to Be Clever"", it was the band's first UK #1 hit. In the United States, the single was released in November 1982 and also became a huge hit, reaching #2 for three weeks.  - Mark Snow (born August 26, 1946) is an American composer for film and television, perhaps best known for his work with ""The X-Files"".  - Giovanni Giorgio Moroder (born 26 April 1940) is an Italian singer, songwriter, DJ and record producer. Moroder is frequently credited with pioneering Italo disco and electronic dance music.  - Italo disco (sometimes hyphenated, such as Italo-disco, subjected to varying capitalization, or abbreviated as Italo) is a genre of progressive music which originated in Italy and was mainly produced at the end of the 1970s to late-1980s. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s.  - The X-Files is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by Chris Carter, which originally aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on Fox. The program spanned nine seasons, included 202 episodes, and a feature film of the same name. Later in 2008, a was made and preceded a tenth season revival, which consisted of six episodes, in 2016. The series revolves around FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who investigate X-Files: marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries to debunk his work and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a very few select people. They develop a close relationship which begins as a platonic friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning story arc, ""Monster-of-the-Week"" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.  - DJ Dado ( born Flavio Daddato , 6 January 1967 ) is an Italian disc jockey and record producer who is mostly known for his remix of Mark Snow 's theme for X-Files , and for covering Giorgio Moroder 's `` The Legend Of Babel '' . He produced dream trance music between 1994 and 2004 , and has done many remixes for other artists such as Boy George , Jean - Michel Jarre , and Italian singer Alexia .  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'country of citizenship'.

"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the judge's son-in-law? ?  On their 35th wedding anniversary, we hear the story of how the couple met in college. P. J. ""Petey"" Simmons is a wealthy newcomer, so rival fraternities fight over him. His ego swells as frat boys and comely co-eds alike bid for his time. Petey keeps getting into trouble, too, including an arrest. At a school dance, Petey's shy roommate has worked up the nerve to invite campus beauty Mirabel Allstairs to be his date. The increasingly arrogant Petey ignores his own date, Martha Scroggs, dancing with other girls instead. Petey pulls pranks on campus, going so far as to change a professor's clocks to delay an exam. A later act of vandalism leads to yet another arrest. This time the judge threatens to throw the book at Petey, sentencing him to six months in jail. Petey asks for a week's continuance before sentencing, then uses the time to court Martha, having discovered her to be the daughter of the judge. Once his scheme is revealed, Petey is locked in the town jail by the angry judge. Martha is smitten with him now, however, throws a rock to get arrested so she can end up in the next cell, holding hands with Petey between the bars. Back in the present, the old judge still can't believe how his daughter and son-in-law ended up together. They also hear that Petey Jr. has just been placed under arrest, which doesn't surprise the judge a bit.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

"'American Idol' creator Simon Fuller: The show 'will be coming back for sure'
""American Idol will be right back, after the break."" Ryan Seacrest has uttered that sentence hundreds of times over the last 15 years. But now those words are taking on a new meaning.

As the series ends its run on Fox, creator Simon Fuller tells The Hollywood Reporter that he is thinking, ""How does Idol live for the next 15 years?"" Says the 55-year-old CEO of XIX Entertainment, who came up with the concept for Idol back in 2002: ""There will no doubt be another format or refinement or elevation of the format. Now I can actually revamp it and come up with a new version. And we can look back on 15 seasons and think of some legitimate ways to allow people to enjoy them again, maybe adding another dimension to it.""

Indeed, Fuller, who worked in music publishing and A&R before managing artists like the Spice Girls, is already planning American Idol, ""the next generation."" Over the course of an hour on a recent afternoon, he talked to THR about the next steps in the evolution of Idol, while looking back at series' early years.

How important is it to you to preserve the legacy of American Idol?

Simon Fuller: For the last 15 seasons we've been very protective of the TV show. We've never done more than one season a year. The touring and merchandising has always been thoughtful. I think we've had great integrity [in] protecting the brand so it wasn't tarnished. So here we are facing our last season on Fox and now the legacy can be more in our focus. Now we can catch our breath. It allows me to rethink the show for the first time. When you're a No. 1 show, it's hard to be too bold and brazen about changing the format because it's working and succeeding. Also, you're always rushing to get the next season completed. Now we start with a clean sheet of paper.

The broadcasting landscape has changed so much since Idol debuted. How will streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu affect the next incarnation of the series?

There are loads of ideas being shared and I'm deep in thought about how we can evolve Idol. We debuted at the very beginning of the digital world. So the next generation of Idol will be a lot more interactive, a lot more immersive. For me the most exciting thing is we can really now dive deep with all the new technology that's coming. My head is exploding with opportunities. The next generation of Idol -- and Idol will certainly be coming back for sure -- will have a youthful glow and it will be pioneering again, just as it was when we first began.

How do you feel going into the final week of Idol on Fox?

The overriding emotion is pride. It's been an amazing 15 years and it's the first time ever that I've been able to look back and think, wow, that was pretty good. We made our mark; we made history. It's exceeded all expectations. In the entertainment industry, you very rarely get to look back. For the first time, I've managed to do that in these past two or three weeks and that will carry me through the finale. Saying goodbye to a lot of people I may not work with again, that's the only sadness for me. [Along with] my partners at Fremantle, I think the group [working on the] show has been pretty much the same since day one. I'm pleased that the final show will still have the warmth and the excitement as the first show 15 seasons ago. In many ways it still feels youthful.

Observing the studio audiences over the years, it's clear that Idol has appealed to all ages and that's its been one of the rare series entire families watch together.

I think that's certainly one of the legacy points. It was a show that the family could watch. Music unites people. Whether you're five or you're 55 or 85, the musical tastes of the world are more aligned than they ever have been. There was a time when what a teenager liked would be polar opposite to what their parents would like. That's not the case anymore.

Looking back on the 15 years, what are your personal highlights?

The first season finale with Kelly [Clarkson] and Justin [Guarini], I thought that was a very special moment. Finding Carrie Underwood was significant. When you saw her, even in her innocent, raw state, you knew she had the potential to be a big star. Kelly and Carrie represent the purity of Idol...; the perfect American dream. I think Chris Daughtry's journey was a significant one. People thought he had a good chance of winning and he got knocked out early, but his talent saw him through. It allowed him in some ways to reinvent himself and create Daughtry the band, so he had this rock persona that maybe would have been a little bit harder for him to achieve if he had been a solo winner and won the whole show. And he went on to sell millions of records and so in the most unlikely way, he achieved all his dreams too.

Do you have a favorite performance?

I have so many. Adam Lambert doing ""Mad World"" was one of my favorites. It was unexpected and magnificent.

Have you thought about the impact that the show has had on the economy?

I quite often think about that. It's something that hasn't been recognized as much as it should have been. Whether that's all the people employed, the hotels that have been booked, the hundreds of thousands of concert tickets sold, all that music that's been sold, all the merchandise, all those people that are fueling other shows, Broadway and the movies that our stars have been in. The advertisers that have bought into the show. We had that wonderful close relationship with iTunes for many years. The impact of Idol and its value is billions and billions.

How did Idol's relationship with the music industry change over the years?

I created Idol to find another path to break artists -- I could see them [perform] and engage with the the audience who would, in a way, tell me who they felt was interesting and who they believed could go on and be a star. It was a new paradigm -- a new way to take an artist and music to the consumer, and have them buy the songs and go and see the concerts. I didn't need the music industry. So initially, there was a little bit of resentment. Not overt, more like -- Well, hang on, this is bypassing the development process, the A&R process, the talent scout process, the producing and it can't have value because you can't do that. It's too quick, no one's paid their dues, they haven't learned their trade, it can't be good enough, it can't be appropriate. And so there was a little bit of disdain toward Idol. But the success was massive all over the world -- this was happening in England, in Germany, in Australia, in South Africa, in Sweden, in India -; everywhere young, new artists were selling millions of records and being No. 1 in every country in the world -- you could not ignore it. We worked with Sony for many years and then Universal. We embraced the industry; we didn't alienate it. And then, guess what? Everyone wanted to be on a TV show, everyone wanted to create a TV show and there were hundreds of them around the world.

I like to think that Idol helped the music industry grow up a bit and understand that music can be everywhere. It was a point when the music industry was going through so much change; it was the advent of the digital age. The digital world shocked the music industry. They withdrew into their own world rather than step out and be strident and confident. And I was strident and confident. I just went for it. And I think the success I had gave everybody confidence.

Do you recall where you were when the first kernel of the idea to create American Idol came into your mind?

At my house in the South of France. I would spend my summers there. The first thoughts of what this could were: how do you use the internet and create an interactive experience where people can affect the outcome or choose the songs than an artist would sing, or choose the members? I have had so many great ideas there. It's the time when I can relax and I'm not doing anything and I'm the most comfortable.

What else is on your plate right now?

I've got a diverse company that [includes] my fashion businesses with Victoria and David Beckham and Roland Mouret. I'm active in many different sports. I just acquired the Miami soccer franchise with David Beckham. We found the land to build our stadium; last week we closed on that. I'm doing a new TV show for the BBC, which is quite different from what I've done previously, which I'll keep secret [for now], but it's a very exciting project, with a global perspective. I'm very excited about the new technologies. I'm working with a company called Pulse, creating a virtual pop star. I've spent a whole lot of time thinking about this, I've been waiting for the technology to be good enough to make it happen. We have the digital rights for Elvis Presley and we're building a virtual reality show around him. We're still launching new artists and we still have Annie Lennox and Aloe Blacc so music is still very prominent in all that I do.

Where do you feel most at home these days?

I love Los Angeles. I come from England and lived in London for many years. My wife is American and when we were dating she moved to live with me in London. Then we got married and when we had Grace, our first child, Natalie wanted to move to America. I said, ""Let's go!"" and that was six years ago and I love living here. I love American people and I feel so at home. I'm happy here. Los Angeles is an extraordinary city. It's always been an important city but now it's an essential city. If you have any aspirations in tech or in entertainment you have to be in Los Angeles. Fashion is moving here. It's a truly great city.

"Answer the following question: I can use this background: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring cities had different climates. Dune city had very dry air and no rain, while Bay city had very high humidity, fog and lots of rain.  Answer this question please: Which city had less damage to cars because of corrosion?

"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about:

Pick a wall that allows the whole room to see the TV and will provide the best picture quality and won’t be affected by sunlight coming in from windows. You also need to consider the position of the furniture in the room and what direction they face.  Because you need to screw holes into the wall to mount your LCD TV, be sure of your placement before you begin mounting it! In a living room, the center of the wall across from the main entranceway allows for a wider viewing angle. Place your TV on the wall where it’s most likely to be at eye level when you’re viewing it. If you plan to mostly watch it while sitting on the sofa you’ll want to place it lower than you would if you plan to mostly watch it while standing or at a bar. Use a ruler or tape measure to measure from the floor to the best height to put the TV at eye level and lightly mark the height with a pencil.  Placing your TV with the center at 42 inches (110 cm) off the ground will put the screen at eye level with the average adult sitting down. If you plan to view the TV more often while standing, then mount it with the center of the TV 53 inches (130 cm) from the ground. Mount the TV as close to eye level as possible if there’s an obstruction such as an existing appliance or piece of furniture. The cables and wires of your TV and any devices you plan to connect to it can be unsightly. When you’re picking a place to mount your TV, think about how difficult it will be for you to conceal them to help inform your decision.  Centering the TV on a bare wall in the center of the room may make it difficult for you to hide the wires. Use furniture placement to help conceal the wires. You need to have a clear area to work in when you’re mounting your LCD TV. Slide over any chairs, tables, or sofas so you can access the wall easily. Take down any paintings, pictures, or decor so they’re out of your way.  Gently place the items that were hanging on the wall nearby so you don’t crack or break them. Take down anything hanging on the wall so they can’t wobble, shake, or potentially fall when you’re drilling into the wall.

"Men at Work were an Australian rock band best known for their 1981 hit ""Down Under"". Formed in 1979, their founding mainstay was Colin Hay on lead vocals; he formed the group with Jerry Speiser on drums and Ron Strykert on lead guitar. They were joined by Greg Ham on flute, saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass guitar. This line-up achieved national and international success in the early 1980s.

During 1984 the band took a break as members pursued other interests. Upon reconvening later that year, tensions during rehearsals between Hay and Speiser over songwriting and the band's management led to a split in the band. Both Rees and Speiser were told they were ""not required"", as Hay, Ham and Strykert used session musicians to record their third album, Two Hearts (23 April 1985). Studio musicians included Jeremy Alsop on bass guitar (ex-Ram Band, Pyramid, Broderick Smith Band); and Mark Kennedy on drums (Spectrum, Ayers Rock, Marcia Hines Band). Two Hearts was produced by Hay and Ham. It was a critical and commercial failure compared to their previous albums and only peaked at No. 16 in Australia, and No. 50 on the US chart. Strykert had left during its production.  Four tracks were released as singles, ""Everything I Need"" (May 1985), ""Man with Two Hearts"", ""Maria"" (August), and ""Hard Luck Story"" (October); only the lead single charted in Australia (No. 37) and the US (No. 47). The album relied heavily on drum machines and synthesisers, and reduced the presence of Ham's saxophone, giving it a different feel compared to its predecessors. Hay and Ham hired new bandmates, to tour in support of Two Hearts, with Alsop and Kennedy joined by James Black on guitar and keyboards (Mondo Rock, The Black Sorrows). Soon after a third guitarist, Colin Bayley (Mi-Sex), was added and Kennedy was replaced on drums by Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa). Australian singers Kate Ceberano and Renee Geyer had also worked on the album and performed live as guest vocalists.  On 13 July 1985 Men at Work performed three tracks for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program)--""Maria"", ""Overkill"", and an unreleased one, ""The Longest Night"". They were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. ""Maria"" and ""Overkill"" were also broadcast by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) during their Live Aid telecast. Ham left during the band's time touring behind the album. The final Men at Work performances during 1985 had jazz saxophonist Paul Williamson (The Black Sorrows), replacing Ham. By early 1986 the band was defunct and Hay started recording his first solo album, Looking for Jack (January 1987), which had Alsop and Wackerman as session musicians.

"Information:  - Sir John Betjeman, CBE (28 August 190619 May 1984) was an English poet, writer, and broadcaster who described himself in ""Who's Who"" as a ""poet and hack"". He was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1972 until his death.  - High Windows is a collection of poems by English poet Philip Larkin, and was published in 1974 by Faber and Faber Limited. The readily available paperback version was first published in Britain in 1979. The collection is the last publication of new poetry by Larkin before his death in 1985, and it contains some of his most famous poems, including the title piece, ""High Windows"", ""Dublinesque"", and ""This Be The Verse"". The collection contains themes presented in his earlier collections, though the tone of the poems caused critics to suggest the book is darker and more ""socially engaged"" than his earlier volumes. It is currently on the AQA AS/A2 level English Literature syllabus.  - ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" is a poem in the form of a villanelle, and the most famous work of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (19141953). Though first published in the journal ""Botteghe Oscure"" in 1951, it was actually written in 1947 when he was in Florence with his family. It was published, along with other stories previously written, as part of his ""In Country Sleep, And Other Poems"" in 1952.  - The Whitsun Weddings is a collection of 32 poems by Philip Larkin. It was first published by Faber and Faber in the United Kingdom on 28 February 1964. It was a commercial success, by the standards of poetry publication, with the first 4,000 copies being sold within two months. A United States edition appeared some seven months later.  - The Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry is awarded for a book of verse published by someone in any of the Commonwealth realms. Originally the award was open only to British subjects living in the United Kingdom, but in 1985 the scope was extended to include people from the rest of the Commonwealth realms. Recommendations to the Queen for the award of the Medal are made by a committee of eminent scholars and authors chaired by the Poet Laureate. In recent times, the award has been announced on the (traditional date of the) birthday of William Shakespeare, 23 April. But Don Paterson was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry alongside the 2010 New Year Honours.  - The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse is a poetry anthology edited by Philip Larkin. It was published in 1973 by Oxford University Press with ISBN 0-19-812137-7. Larkin writes in the short preface that the selection is wide rather than deep; and also notes that for the post-1914 period it is more a collection of poems, than of poets. The remit was limited by him to poets with a period of residence in the British Isles. The volume contains works by 207 poets.  - Under Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, ""Under Milk Wood"" directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  - Philip Arthur Larkin (9 August 1922  2 December 1985) was an English poet, novelist and librarian. His first book of poetry, ""The North Ship"", was published in 1945, followed by two novels, ""Jill"" (1946) and ""A Girl in Winter"" (1947), and he came to prominence in 1955 with the publication of his second collection of poems, ""The Less Deceived"", followed by ""The Whitsun Weddings"" (1964) and ""High Windows"" (1974). He contributed to ""The Daily Telegraph"" as its jazz critic from 1961 to 1971, articles gathered in ""All What Jazz: A Record Diary 196171"" (1985), and he edited ""The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse"" (1973). His many honours include the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. He was offered, but declined, the position of Poet Laureate in 1984, following the death of Sir John Betjeman.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as ""one of America's original art forms"".  - Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914  9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" and ""And death shall have no dominion""; the 'play for voices' ""Under Milk Wood""; and stories and radio broadcasts such as ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" and ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog"". He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a ""roistering, drunken and doomed poet"".  - The Less Deceived, first published in 1955, was Philip Larkin's first mature collection of poetry, having been preceded by the derivative ""North Ship"" (1945) from The Fortune Press and a privately printed collection, a small pamphlet titled ""XX Poems"", which Larkin mailed to literary critics and authors. Unfortunately, Larkin was unaware that postal rates had gone up, and most recipients, when asked to pay the difference for delivery of a pamphlet by a little-known writer, turned them away, only around 100 copies were printed.  - ""And death shall have no dominion"" is a poem written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (19141953). The title comes from St. Paul's epistle to the Romans (6:9).  - The North Ship is a collection of poems by Philip Larkin ( 1922 - 1985 ) , and was published in 1945 by Reginald A. Caton 's Fortune Press . Caton did not pay his writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves . A similar arrangement had been used in 1934 by Dylan Thomas for his first anthology . The volume was published again , in 1966 , by Faber and Faber Limited . In the 1945 version there are 31 items , numbered with Roman numerals . The last of these , `` The North Ship '' is a set of five poems tracking a ship 's northward progress .

"Coming off their overtime win over the Patriots, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for their first of two matches with their AFC West division rivals, the San Diego Chargers. On the Broncos' opening drive, quarterback Brock Osweiler connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Chargers had a chance to get on the scoreboard midway through the first quarter, but placekicker Josh Lambo missed wide-right on a 48-yard field goal attempt. Toward the end of the first quarter, the Broncos added to the lead, when linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted an errant pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers and returned it for a 25-yard touchdown. After forcing a Chargers' punt early in the second quarter, the Broncos marched down the field with a long drive that chewed up seven minutes, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus that increased their lead to 17-0. The Chargers got on the scoreboard just after the two minute warning, with a 51-yard field goal by Lambo, which would be the final scoring play of the game by either team. In the third quarter, the Broncos' defense recovered two forced fumbles, while on offense, McManus missed wide right on a 52-yard field goal attempt and Osweiler threw an interception deep in Chargers' territory. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos' offense punted on all of their possessions (save the final kneel down), while their defense did not allow the Chargers' offense to advance past their own 47-yard line. NotesThe Broncos swept their division rivals on the road for the sixth time in seven seasons.

"Chicago Cubs:

In 1975, a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington, D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society. The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans, currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban, who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run. Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player, explains columnist George Will, because ""He exemplified mediocrity under pressure, he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics."" Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed, but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan, also a society member, at the White House. Hillary Clinton, Jim Belushi, Joe Mantegna, Rahm Emanuel, Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership.

"Catherine V. ""Ginny"" Kilgore of Oxford, an attorney with North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, has been recognized for her dedication to serving the indigent. Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. ""Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,"" said Davis. ""Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most."" ""This award means a great deal to me,"" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. ""The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored."" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. ""I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I've dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family."" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college.

"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?
Many programs will teach you how to market yourself so you can build your business. One thing that you can do is build a website. This website will help people in your area who need a relationship coach find you.  On your website, you need to list all of your education, qualifications, and certifications. You should also list all your relative experience. Emphasize any of your specializations and areas of focus. Social media is a great way to build your brand and your business. You can put your relationship coaching business on different social media sites to help build network and professional connections.  You can use Facebook and Twitter to help get the word out about your new business. Encourage friends, family, and acquaintances to share your page and spread the word about the services you offer. Use professional social media sites like LinkedIn to help meet other relationship coaches. Meeting other people in the field can help you make professional connections and potentially grow your business. You may also find out about professional development opportunities, relationship coaching events, and other opportunities through these sites.  You should also try to get your name listed on relationship coaching websites. Look for national directories you can place your name so potential clients in your area can search for you. You set the amount you charge for each session. Sessions can range from $60 to $150 for a session. The amount you choose to charge may depend on various circumstances.  At first, you may not want to charge too much since you are a new relationship coach who is trying to build a client list. If you are providing coaching to single people, you may choose to charge less than couples or families. The amount you charge may depend on the length of the session. Some sessions may run 45 minutes while others might last for 90 minutes. You may decide to charge more for longer sessions. To start a career in relationship coaching, you have to take on clients. Don’t get discouraged if it takes a few weeks or months to get your business off the ground. Keep advertising on social media and placing your name on relationship coaching directories. Once you start building a client list, decide how many clients you want to take on at once. You may want to focus on a few people at first, or try to get a full-time load.  If you are struggling to gain new clients at first, offer reduced rates to your family and friends. Try offering reduced rates for new clients or the first ten clients who sign up for coaching sessions. You may decide to offer a free introductory session. This gives someone the option of meeting and talking with you to decide if you are a good fit. This might be good for people who are hesitant to spend money to find a relationship coach they may not like or if they are nervous because you are new to the field.

"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who is most generally associated with his piano arrangement of the folk dance tune ""Country Gardens""? from the following article ?  Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.  Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune ""Country Gardens"". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year...

Data from the National Crime Agency (NCA) reveals more than 335,000 missing person calls were made in 2015/16.
The figure is an increase of 15% on the previous year.
The data also shows that around one in every five missing persons was an individual who had some form of mental health issue.

the number of missing people calls received by police forces
370
individual people reported as being missing everyday
79% of missing people return within 24 hours
22% of incidents involving a missing person are due to the person having a mental health issue
The families of those searching for a loved one have said the experience leaves them devastated.
Margaret Cooper, who has been searching for her son Steven, who went missing from his home in Huddersfield in 2008, said: ""Its the not knowing, that's the worst thing.
""One day I think he's dead and then another I think he's still alive.""
Steven was last seen in Scotland and officers from West Yorkshire searched Loch Laggan in 2011 as part of their investigation, but no sign of him has ever been found.
Ms Cooper added: ""If I had a body, because he'd died, I could then grieve - but having no idea what's happened to him has left me in limbo.
""Throughout the initial search it just didn't feel real, it was like being in a bubble, and it was so hard because there was no reason we could think of as to why he would disappear.""
The NCA said its latest report is its ""most complete assessment to date"" of people going missing in the UK.
The majority of police forces reported a rise in the number of missing people calls they had handled, although the NCA warned year-on-year comparisons should be treated with caution as each force records data differently.
Det Ch Insp Chris Gibson of West Yorkshire Police, which said it had seen a 72% increase in the number of calls received, said: ""I think people are more aware now of the issue of missing people.
""We've also improved the way we record missing people, so that contributes to the rising numbers.
""But, for us, this is a really important issue and when we identify that a vulnerable person is missing we'll have officers on the ground out searching in less than 15 minutes"".
For the first time the NCA has also published data that examines why people go missing.
It shows that one in five people who disappear are reported to have some form of mental health issue.
Abduction and relationship issues are also two of the most common reasons why people disappear.
Claire Cook, from the charity Missing People, said the issue affects people from all backgrounds.
She said: ""If someone goes missing it signals there's a problem.
""For adults, the common issues are mental health problems and relationship breakdowns, whilst if a child goes missing it's often a sign that there's something wrong at home.
""What's clear is that it's not just the police that have to deal with missing people, this is a societal issue and one we have to tackle together"".

"Write a summary based on this article:

One moment Sheila Keen Warren was on a trip to see her mom in Vermont. The next, she was handcuffed and placed in the back of a Virginia sheriff’s cruiser. 
  
 “Where are we going?” “Am I under arrest and what for?” “Is my husband under arrest?” the 54-year-old blond-haired woman in the bright aqua tank top, capri jeans and flip-flops asked. 
  
 Back at the sheriff’s headquarters, she sat in an interview room making small talk about her nickname “Debbie” and where she lived. 
  
 But then the conversation turned serious when she was told she’s the accused shooter in South Florida’s killer clown case from 27 years earlier. 
  
 Authorities had come to hold her accountable for the May 26, 1990, slaying of Marlene Warren, 40, in Wellington. 
  
 Keen Warren placed her head down on a desk and declined to say another word. 
  
 This glimpse of Keen Warren’s Sept. 26 capture, and the renewed investigation that led to it after all these years, is detailed in files released Thursday by the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, in response to public records requests. 
  
 The records explain how recent testing of DNA evidence was the key to cracking a high-profile case that had long gone cold but is now the center of a death penalty prosecution. 
  
 Sheila Keen Warren is facing charges in the death of Marlene Warren in 1990. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the 54-year-old woman accused of wearing a clown disguise during the May 26, 1990, slaying of Marlene Warren, 40, in Wellington. 
  
 Keen Warren’s husband, Michael Warren, was married to the murder victim and was labeled an original person of interest by police. Authorities won’t say if he is still a suspect. 
  
 Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters after Keen Warren’s arrest it “remains to be seen” whether anyone else will be charged in the case. Michael Warren, who has long denied any role, was en route to Calder Race Track with friends at the time his wife was shot at their home in the Aero Club community. 
  
 The 2,847 pages of documents released Thursday include new allegations along with all of the original investigative reports that made the case so remarkable: Marlene Warren opened the door to greet a clown wearing an orange wig, a red bulb nose, gloves and a smile painted on its white face. The clown held two balloons and flowers in one hand and a pistol in the other. 
  
 The clown fired at Warren’s face. She died within two days. The clown fled in a white Chrysler LeBaron, which was found four days later abandoned at a shopping center parking lot. 
  
 Here are some of the revelations from the evidence also recently shared with Keen Warren’s lawyer: 
  
 — Detectives collected samples of Sheila Keen’s hair and vials of her blood through a June 1990 search warrant, because she was then a suspect. There was also a court-ordered search of her apartment that yielded fibers from a bright orange wig and clothing that police were checking for blood stains. And similar fibers were found in the getaway car. 
  
 — In the reopened investigation, those samples were sent to an FBI crime lab and some matches were made to fibers collected from the Chrysler, though a precise DNA connection is not included. “Sheila Keen can be included as a possible source of these hairs,” according to a 2016 investigator’s report. But the FBI lab’s report was not released to reporters. 
  
 — Michael Warren was listed as the beneficiary of a life insurance police issued for his wife Marlene Warren in March 1979. In May 2017, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance confirmed that “the death claim was paid in June 1991 in the amount of $53,359.37 to Michael Warren.” 
  
 — An attorney, Christopher DeSantis, gave investigators a statement in 1991 concerning his conversation two years earlier with Michael Warren as they left a courthouse. Warren “asked me what the ramifications would be if a husband killed his wife on her estate,” DeSantis said then. The lawyer advised that if the husband had a friend who did it and they couldn’t tie the husband to the friend, he’d get away Scott free. 
  
 — In October 2017, DeSantis gave another statement to investigators. This time, he said he “he told Mike Warren … that if someone wore a clown suit they would get off because no one would be able to identify the features such as male/female or identity of the person committing the crime.” 
  
 — One day after Keen Warren’s arrest, Palm Beach County detectives met with an employee of the Kingsport, Tenn., restaurant formerly owned by Michael and Sheila Keen Warren. The employee, Julia Thomas, said her former roommate and co-worker, Danielle Sweeting, told her of a time that “Debbie” got drunk and confessed to her. “Debbie said that she had picked out the clown outfit and killed his wife,” Thomas recalled. 
  
 — Marlene’s son Joseph Ahrens and another person, Jean Pratt, got into a car and chased the clown moments after the shooting. Detectives wrote that Jean Pratt told investigators in a June 27, 1991, statement that “the clown suspect was definitely a man. … It wasn’t a woman.” 
  
 — Michael Warren’s friends told police that he “did not act very upset” after his wife’s death. Witnesses told the cops that a few months before the murder they observed fights between Marlene and Michael Warren, as well as Marlene confronting Sheila Keen about having an affair with Michael. 
  
 — Marlene Warren’s funeral was videotaped, but detectives who reviewed it saw nothing useful to the investigation. 
  
 For the past 15 years, the Warrens lived in small, historic Abingdon, Va., within the Blue Ridge Mountains. They had a reputation as a hardworking, sociable couple who until last year operated a popular fast-food restaurant in nearby Kingsport, Tenn. 
  
 Keen, then 27, had been working for Michael Warren’s used car dealership, Bargain Motors Inc. of West Palm Beach, helping to repossess cars. 
  
 During the original murder investigation, detectives discovered Warren was rolling back odometers on vehicles at his used car lot. He was convicted of racketeering and multiple other felonies and served nearly four years in a minimum-security state prison at the Homestead Correctional Institution. He was released on New Year's Eve 1997. ||||| WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two nights before a clown fatally shot a woman at her front door, a customer showed up at a nearby costume shop and begged to be let in at closing. 
  
 On this night 28 years ago, the woman urgently told two clerks she needed a clown suit, an orange wig, white gloves, a red nose and enough white makeup to cover her face completely. She passed on the floppy shoes. One of the clerks in a photo lineup identified the customer as Sheila Keen, who was rumored in May 1990 to be having an affair with victim Marlene Warren's husband. The other clerk thought it might be Keen, but wasn't 100 percent. 
  
 Palm Beach County prosecutors released late Thursday evidence that they say helped them and sheriff's detectives to arrest Keen in September at the Abington, Virginia, home she shared with her husband — Michael Warren, Marlene Warren's widower. The evidence includes hundreds of pages of witness statements, photographs, reports and maps. It also says recent DNA tests conducted by the FBI say hair found in a car linked to the slaying could have come from Sheila Keen Warren. 
  
 Prosecutors released the evidence without comment. Her attorney, Richard Lubin, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. Michael Warren, reached by phone, declined comment. Detectives have declined to rule him out as a possible suspect. Keen Warren, now 54, remains jailed without bond. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. 
  
 According to the documents, she became a suspect shortly after the slaying. 
  
 Marlene Warren, 40, opened her door on a Saturday morning to find a clown in an orange wig, a red nose but normal high-top shoes holding two foil balloons and carnations. Her then 20-year-old son and his friends, who were in the house, say the clown handed her the gifts. The clown without saying a word then shot her in the face, walked slowly to a Chrysler LeBaron convertible and drove away. 
  
 Michael Warren at the time owned a used car lot and Sheila Keen did repossessions for him. Other employees, according to the document, told detectives Warren and Keen had been seen kissing and having sex in the office and her neighbors said he was frequently at her house. Warren and Keen denied a relationship. They married in 2002. 
  
 The documents show that immediately after the shooting, detectives worked to find where the clown costume, the balloons and flowers had been purchased and to find the car. Along with the costume shop employees, the detectives learned the flowers and balloons came from a supermarket a half mile from the victim's home, bought by a woman who looked like Keen who wore white gloves. 
  
 The LeBaron was soon found abandoned in a parking lot. It had been reported stolen by a Payless rental agency near Michael Warren's car lot, Bargain Motors. The couple who rented it last told detectives they had arrived afterhours at the Payless, hoping to leave the car. Finding no employees, they went home, looked in the Yellow Pages and called what they thought was Payless. A man told them to leave the car with its keys in the visor in front of the lot and someone would get it. They reluctantly did. 
  
 When they went back later, the car was gone, so they called the number again and the same man acted like he never spoke to them. The next morning they realized they had called Bargain Motors — its Yellow Page ad read ""Payless!"" The rental agency had previously sued Michael Warren over the ad and an employee told detectives Michael Warren and another employee had pulled the ruse to steal the car as payback. No one was ever charged with the theft. 
  
 Warren told detectives he and his wife had a good relationship, but his employees and her family said Marlene Warren had been threatening to divorce him over numerous affairs and a beating she said he had administered a year before. Warren's employees told detectives he had said he would never divorce because his wife would get half his assets. 
  
 Keen was interviewed by detectives shortly after the shooting and blood and hair were collected. She denied being the shooter, saying she was in another part of the county looking for cars that needed to be repossessed. 
  
 Michael Warren was convicted in 1994 of grand theft, racketeering and odometer tampering and served almost four years in prison. After his wedding to Keen, they settled in Virginia just across from Kingsport, Tennessee, where they operated a popular restaurant that they sold just before her arrest. |||||

When she finally reached the office marked ""King Enterprises"", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking.

Now that you've learned about the issues and committed yourself to tackling them, it's time to make yourself heard. Start by stating your beliefs about animal rights in influential public forums. For example, sign on to petitions, write letters to decision-makers, and send editorials to newspapers. If there is a hearing about a particular issue, such as the development of wetlands, sign up to give testimony. Animal rights groups need monetary backing to support their good work. Pick an organization that is running campaigns that you believe in and that are garnering measurable results.  Most organizations make it easy to donate by having secure, online tools for making one-time or monthly contributions. If you choose a registered nonprofit, your donations are tax-deductible. Join and/or volunteer with a group that's dedicated to animal rights. Membership usually involves paying dues, attending meetings, being on their contact list, and participating in sponsored events and campaigns.   Check locally to see if there are organizations that are active in your area. If you'd like to get involved with a major player in the cause, here is a helpful online list of the biggest animal rights groups internationally with links to each: https://speakingofresearch.com/extremism-undone/animal-rights-activists-organizations/. If there's a specific issue, such as factory farming or cosmetics testing, that speaks to you, get involved. There are plenty of ways, large and small, to lend a hand.   Some informal ways to get involved include signing a petition, sharing information on social media, or attending a demonstration. Some more formal ways of participating include attending organizing meetings related to the campaign, volunteering your time to a related event or effort, or taking on a leadership role. The best activism takes advantage of the knowledge and experience that you already have. Ask yourself how you can use your education, career, and/or hobbies to help the cause of animal rights.

I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, ""This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.""  Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.

"What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his ""emotional restraint"" and ""riveting rhythmic drive""). He nevertheless won an ""honorable mention"" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

A review, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, also suggests these patients are less likely to respond to treatment.
Nearly one in 20 people in the UK has this form of depression as a result of childhood abuse, say researchers.
The charity Sane said the study highlighted how damaging childhood trauma could be.
Depression in some form can affect one in five people at some point in their lives. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London were investigating depression which keeps on recurring.
They reviewed 16 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 patients, and found that maltreatment in childhood - such as rejection by the mother, harsh physical treatment or sexual abuse - more than doubled the risk of this type of depression.
One of the researchers, Dr Rudolf Uher, said: ""If these things happen early in life, it is more powerful.""
In the UK, 16% of people develop persistent depression by the age of 33. A quarter of them, or 4% of the whole UK population, were maltreated as a child.
In the study:
A separate review on 3,098 people showed childhood maltreatment was also linked to a poorer response to both drug and psychological treatment.
Lead researcher Dr Andrea Danese said: ""Even for combined treatments, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment cannot be adequately cared for.""
Their report suggests ""early preventive and therapeutic interventions may be more effective.""
There is no precise explanation of any link between abuse, changes in the body as a child and persistent depression 20 or more years later.
Childhood maltreatment, it is thought, causes changes to the brain, immune system and some hormone glands - some of which are still present in adulthood.
One possible mechanism is what is known as epigenetic changes to the DNA. While there is no change in the genetic code, the environment can alter the way genes are expressed.
Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: ""It may seem obvious that traumatic events in our lives can make us depressed, but this study highlights how particularly damaging such traumas can be when experienced during childhood, when our brains are still developing.
""We should all be concerned at how abuse and neglect creates a painful legacy that can last a lifetime, increasing our chances of experiencing repeated episodes of depression and reducing the effects of those treatments that are available to us.
""Yet we should not lose hope. Research such as this can point the way to better treatments and preventative measures.""",0,0,0,1,0,0

In the second quarter, the Broncos continued to struggle as Hanson gave Detroit a 53-yard field goal, while QB Jon Kitna completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey.  The Lions would end the half with Hanson kicking a 38-yard field goal.  Even worse, starting QB Jay Cutler (3/4 for 20 yards) would leave the game with a lower left leg injury.

"Summarize this article in one sentence.
It can be something like “I need to leave now” or even something silly like “My monster needs me.” It’s about trying to keep the person bullying you off-balance. This often confuses the bully enough that he or she is less sure of how you will respond the next time the possibility of bullying arises. Bullying often follows a script, and you want to change it so the bully is off-balance.  If you are a bystander and see someone being bullied, try to create a distraction or take the bully's attention off of what he's doing. You can also provide an interruption by telling the person being bullied like, ""Hey, I really need to talk to you for a second"" or ""Mr. X wants to see you for a minute."" If they follow you, or it happens again and you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to stop. If the person refuses, detail the steps you will take to deal with the situation.  For example, you can say something like, ""Please stop calling me mean names. If you don't, I will report you to the principal."" It's important not to give bullying an audience if you're a bystander. Attention will only encourage the bully. Don't laugh at or encourage bullying behavior. If it feels safe, you can even say something like, ""That's really not funny"" or ""Take it easy."" No matter how the person who is bullying you responds, staying calm will show them their efforts to upset you aren’t working. Show that you are unaffected by their actions, even if you are inside. Write down as exactly as you can what they said and did and who was there. This can help when you talk to teachers or people in authority about the situation. Letting people in authority know will make it harder for the person who does the bullying to continue. You might not be the only one suffering, and it might be time for the school administration to take action against that person. It’s important to have a record of complaint against the person doing the bullying in case it continues. If the verbal abuse has taken the form of sexist, racist, or homophobic slurs, you also might want to reach out to teachers involved in student groups trying to combat sexism, racism, and homophobia. Change your routes. Go with a crowd whenever you can. Bullies often avoid taking on someone with a group around them. If the bullying consists of any physical violence, go to the police immediately. Threats of violence should also be reported to the police, as they are illegal in many jurisdictions. Being the target of bullying is not your fault.  No one should have to deal with bullying, social isolation, and shaming alone. Even if people who were your friends have gotten involved in the social bullying situation, look for new activities and new friends. Get yourself out of the toxic situation. If needed, speaking with a school counselor, joining a ""beat-bullying"" group, or seeing a therapist may also help with your emotional pain.

Abstract: PURPOSE Minimal (< 10 mm thick) pleural effusion (PE) may represent an early phase of malignant PE, but its clinical relevance has rarely been studied. Therefore, we examined the proportion of minimal PE in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its impact on survival. We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set.   
 PATIENTS AND METHODS On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival.   
 RESULTS Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2% stage I, 10.9% stage II, 13.2% stage IIIA, 23.8% stage IIIB, and 13.9% stage IV. Minimal PE correlated significantly with shorter survival time than did no PE (median survival time, 7.7 v 17.7 months; log-rank P < .001), even after full adjustment with all variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.62). Prognostic impact of minimal PE was higher in early versus advanced stages (Pinteraction = .001). In 237 patients (87.8%) with minimal PE, pleural invasion or attachment as a direct mechanism was observed, and it was an independent factor predicting worse survival (P = .03).   
 CONCLUSION Minimal PE is a commonly encountered clinical concern in staging NSCLCs. Its presence is an important prognostic factor of worse survival, especially in early-stage disease.. Title: Mitotic chromosomes fold by condensin-dependent helical winding of chromatin loop arrays

During the two-hour ITV talent show, contestants were repeatedly shown using Samsung products  – and on another occasion, a TV catch-up service from another sponsor was featured.

Boy-band Kingsland Road later reviewed their performance using the subscription-free TV service, YouView, from another show sponsor, TalkTalk. Fans expressed their anger on Twitter.

Volunteer firefighting can be a rewarding way to spend your time, but you will need to be focused and committed to the role. Visit a local fire department, if you haven't already. Ask the firefighters about what it's like to work there. If you personally know any paid or volunteer firefighters, ask them to explain the risks and rewards of volunteering. Read articles and expert columns at sites like http://www.firerescue1.com/volunteer/.  It's important to visit the local fire station. Every fire department is different, and you should make sure that this is a place where you want to spend your time. Go for a ride-along, if possible. If you're serious about volunteering, most fire departments will allow you to ride along in the fire engine for a day while firefighters are responding to emergencies. This might help clarify your decision. Most fire departments require that you sign up for a volunteer schedule or pledge a certain amount of hours to the program.

Ludendorff was born on 9 April 1865 in Kruszewnia near Posen, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia (now Poznan County, Poland), the third of six children of August Wilhelm Ludendorff (1833-1905). His father was descended from Pomeranian merchants who had achieved the prestigious status of Junker. Erich's mother, Klara Jeanette Henriette von Tempelhoff (1840-1914), was the daughter of the noble but impoverished Friedrich August Napoleon von Tempelhoff (1804-1868) and his wife Jeannette Wilhelmine von Dziembowska (1816-1854), who came from a Germanized Polish landed family on the side of her father Stephan von Dziembowski (1779-1859). Through Dziembowski's wife Johanna Wilhelmine von Unruh (1793-1862), Erich was a remote descendant of the Counts of Donhoff, the Dukes of Duchy of Liegnitz and Duchy of Brieg and the Marquesses and Electors of Brandenburg.

In the West in 1916 the Germans attacked unsuccessfully at Verdun and soon were reeling under British and French blows along the Somme. Ludendorff's friends at OHL, led by Max Bauer, lobbied for him relentlessly. The balance was tipped when Romania entered the war, thrusting into Hungary. Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Field Marshal Hindenburg on 29 August 1916. Ludendorff was his chief of staff as first Quartermaster general, with the stipulation that he would have joint responsibility. He was promoted to General of the Infantry. Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg warned the War Cabinet: ""You don't know Ludendorff, who is only great at a time of success. If things go badly he loses his nerve."" Their first concern was the sizable Romanian Army, so troops sent from the Western Front checked Romanian and Russian incursions into Hungary. Then Romania was invaded from the south by German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Ottoman troops commanded by August von Mackensen and from the north by a German and Austro-Hungarian army commanded by Falkenhayn. Bucharest fell in December 1916. According to Mackensen, Ludendorff's distant management consisted of ""floods of telegrams, as superfluous as they were offensive.""  When sure that the Romanians would be defeated OHL moved west, retaining the previous staff except for the operations officer, blamed for Verdun. They toured the Western Front meeting --and evaluating-- commanders, learning about their problems and soliciting their opinions. At each meeting Ludendorff did most of the commander's talking. There would be no further attacks at Verdun and the Somme would be defended by revised tactics that exposed fewer men to British shells. A new backup defensive line would be built, like the one they had constructed in the east. The Allies called the new fortifications the Hindenburg Line. The German goal was victory, which they defined as a Germany with extended borders that could be more easily defended in the next war.  Hindenburg was given titular command over all of the forces of the Central Powers. Ludendorff's hand was everywhere. Every day he was on the telephone with the staffs of their armies and the Army was deluged with ""Ludendorff's paper barrage""  of orders, instructions and demands for information. His finger extended into every aspect of the German war effort. He issued the two daily communiques, and often met with the newspaper and newsreel reporters. Before long the public idolized him as their Army's brain.

Movie title: Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III Context: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film begins with Leatherface bludgeoning a young woman, Gina, to death with a sledgehammer before beginning the process of cutting off her face in order to make it into a mask. Gina's sister, Sara watches from a nearby window. Leatherface hears Sara outside, and after she flees, he briefly checks outside before going back to work. Some time later, Michelle and her boyfriend Ryan, a couple that constantly argues, both traveling through Texas, pass through a security checkpoint near the excavation of a large number of butchered bodies, a cop approaches them and interrogates them, shortly after they leave and reach the Last Chance Gas Station. At the station, they meet a hitchhiking cowboy named Tex and the station's perverted owner Alfredo. Tex shows Ryan a route on the map that can get them to a town. A fight soon breaks out between Tex and Alfredo when Tex finds the latter spying on Michelle while she uses the station restroom. As Michelle and Ryan flee from the station in their car, they witness Alfredo apparently killing Tex with a shotgun. As night falls, Ryan and Michelle, having taken the route Tex recommended, become lost. As they begin to bicker, a large truck appears and the driver attacks them. Ryan pulls over when the unseen driver throws a dead coyote at their windshield. As Ryan changes the car's flat tire, Michelle hears a noise, and Leatherface ambushes the two of them. They climb into the car as Leatherface begins hacking at it with his chainsaw, before bumping Leatherface with the vehicle and driving off. After their escape from Leatherface, Michelle and Ryan - as well as another driver, a survivalist named Benny - crash when a bloodied Tex leaps in front of the car. As Benny tends to Michelle, Ryan explains the situation to him, showing him the damage which Leatherface has...

Plot title: Saturday Night Fever Movie plot: Anthony ""Tony"" Manero (John Travolta) is a 19-year old Italian American living in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. Tony lives at home with his overbearing and abusive, uneducated, working-class parents (Val Bisoglio and Julie Bovasso), and works a dead-end job in a small hardware store by day since graduating from high school. But every Saturday night, Tony is ""king of the dance floor"" at 2001 Odyssey, a local disco club. Tony has four close friends that he goes out with to the disco: Joey (Joseph Cali); Double J (Paul Pape); Gus (Bruce Ornstein); and the diminutive Bobby C. (Barry Miller). Another informal member of their group is Annette (Donna Pescow), a neighborhood girl who longs for a more permanent and physical relationship with Tony.One plot device in the story is the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects from Long Island to Staten Island, on which the friends ritually stop to clown around, but is particularly symbolic to Tony as an escape to a better life on the other side, in more suburban Staten Island.One day, Tony agrees to be Annette's partner in an upcoming dance contest at 2001 Odyssey, but her happiness is short-lived when Tony becomes infatuated with another girl dancing at the club, an older woman named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Stephanie coldly rejects Tony's advances, but eventually agrees to be his partner in the competition, nothing more.Elsewhere, Tony's older brother, Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar), who was the pride of the family since becoming a priest in the Catholic Church, brings despair to their parents when he quits the priesthood. In contrast to his cold relationship with his distant and neglectful parents as well has his non-English speaking grandmother and rambunctious younger sister, Tony shares a warm relationship with Frank Jr., but feels vindicated, no longer being the black sheep of the family.While on his way home from the grocery store, Gus is attacked by a Hispanic gang and is hospitalized, and tells the guys it was the...

Problem:In this darkly humorous thriller, James Caan portrays Romantic novelist Paul Sheldon, famously renowned for his trademark character, the film's namesake 'Misery' Chastaine. shortly after finishing his latest book, he drives of back to New York from the Silver Creek lodge. After a while, his car swerves off the icy road in a blizzard. In the car, he has a flashback in which he is talking to his agent (portrayed by Lauren Bacall) about his last Misery book. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes him back to her house for two days and reveales that she is his number one fan, hence the infamous quote ""I'm your number one fan"". When Annie asks if she can read his new book (in manuscript form) she proves to be more than a little eccentric when she lashes out in a fit of rage over the swearing in his book. When she leaves the room he seems fraked out and looks like he wants to leave quickly. The next day, Annie brings home a copy of the final Misery book and over the days reveals how many pages she has read. During which, she introuces him to her pet sow, Misery.The following night, she nearly kills him over the fact that he has killed Misery in his final book, tells him that she never called the local hospital (which she said she had) and threatens to kill him if anything happens to her. He immediately tries to escape but fails. The next day, Annie seems happy and tries to persuade him to burn the manuscript to which he seems reluctant. Later, she reveals she wants him to write a new book in which Misery comes back to life. When he sees a hairpin on the floor, he has an idea to buy time, he asks Annie to buy some different paper because his current paper smudges, to which she responds with another fit of rage. Whilst she is out shopping, Paul uses the hairpin to unlock his bedroom door and escape. However, he soon finds out that the front door is locked as well. He makes a visit to her living room and medicine closet. In the living room he accidentally knocks a small ceramic penguin off the table and puts it back the wrong way (this will become important later). He also realises that Annie's phone is a fake one, cancelling his chances of contacting the outside world. In the medicine closet, he takes some of the pills the Annie had been giving him for his fracture. He also tries to escape through her back door in the kitchen but cannot open it (I forgot to mention that he was bedridden for a few days and currently in a wheelchair). Soon, he hears Annie returning and immediately races back to his room. Fortunately, he gets back to his room in time just when she opens the door. She gets him back into bed and gives him a notepad and his pills (which he pretends to swallow).The following night, he saves up a lot of powder from the pills. In the morning, an argument starts between Paul and Annie about the book, which escalates into a humorous fit of rage about her growing up in Bakersfield watching chapter plays. Meanwhile, the local authorities find Sheldon's '65 Mustang buried in the snow. When Annie reads some of Paul's new manuscript she responds happily. Paul requsts that Annie have dinner with him to celebrate Misery's return. At the dinner, Paul makes a toast to Misery's return but asks if she has any candles. Whilst Annie is looking for them, Paul puts the powder in her wine. When she returns she almost makes the toast but drops her drink in the process, ruining Paul's plan.The next scene shows a line of clips of Paul writing the book. In the last clip, Annie gives him his pills and talks about committing suicide. When she leaves the house, he goes out of his room again and reads her scrapbook. It includes many newspaper clippings, revealing that she killed her father, her college roommate and many patients in hospitals. He grabs a knife from the kitchen and wheels himself to his room. Later, he awakens to the sight of Annie as she forcibly sedates him. In the morning, she ties him to the bed and reveals that she knows that he has been out of his room (the scrapbook, the ceramic penguin, the hairpin). Then, she 'hobbles' him (puts a block of wood betwen his feet and hits them with a sledgehammer)In the next scene, 'Buster' the local sheriff sees an emotional outburst in the town and researches her history. Later, he pays a visit to her house to look around. When he leaves, he hears a noise and goes back inside to find Paul in the basement and is shot by Annie. When she says she wants to kill him then herself, he requests finishing the book first. later, he is writing the book and requests 3 things: a cigarette, matches, and Dom Perignon champagne. When Annie returns, he also requests two glasses. whilst she is out of the room, he pours flammable liquid onto the manuscript and burns it, which escalates into a brawl resulting in Annie's death.18 months later, Paul is seen in a restaurant with his agent, refusing to write a book about his experiences. He mistakes a waitress for Annie in a haunting vision as she repeats Annie's line: ""I'm your number one fan"".

"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?
You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above.  In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.” In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation."" In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.” In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column. Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following:  =Average(A2:___) Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function:  =Average(A2:A101) This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns.   When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed. In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104. The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be: =A2-$A$104.  The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation. In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need. In cell C2, enter the function =B2^2 After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column.  If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values. Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values.  In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function: =Sum(C2:C101)  When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!). Question: After trying the Aromatic Massage Oil, how does the author feel about the scents overall? Answer:

Pick your answer from:
[A]. She doesn't love them all, but it's pleasant enough for her to use;

"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school?, using the article: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (""The Greek""), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. ""El Greco"" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting., what would be the answer ?

"Write a title for this article:

Confronted with evidence that key files were tampered with, the Government has reopened investigations into a possible cover-up involving suspected Nazi war criminals living in America.

The investigations are being conducted by the Justice Department and the General Accounting Office. They concern allegations of a conspiracy to protect former Nazis and collaborators who may have been smuggled into the United States by American intelligence agencies for cold war operations against the Russians.

Charges that the American authorities mishandled investigations of war criminals date back at least 10 years. But the G.A.O. concluded in 1978 that it could find no evidence of a conspiracy to impede the inquiries. Nearly 200 cases remain under investigation by a unit of the Justice Department, the Office of Special Investigations.

Congressional investigators are also reviewing new information provided by a former prosecutor in that office, including long-secret military documents setting forth links that American intelligence agencies had with Nazis and their East European collaborators.

Episodes described in the documents and other information collected by the former prosecutor, John Loftus, include these cases:

- An Army officer working in intelligence after World War II acknowledged allowing some Nazi collaborators to falsify their applications for American visas in exchange for providing intelligence information.

- Some former Nazis entered the United States through lightly patrolled Canadian and Mexican border crossings while others were routed through Argentina and other cooperative Latin American countries.

- Other former Nazis arrived on cargo planes, after being listed on the waybills as freight.

- One collaborator accused of killings was identified and barred from emigrating to America on five separate occasions by American counterintelligence agents. Yet with the help of other agents, he finally gained entry to this country.

Mr. Loftus first made public on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' last Sunday his charges that hundreds of Nazi collaborators were illegally brought into the country after World War II to form an anti-Soviet spy army. Masterminding the efforts, he said, was a highly secret covert operations agency close to the State Department called the Office of Policy Coordination.

Mr. Loftus, who has written a book about his findings as a war crimes investigator, provided a draft of the book and documents to Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The book is tentatively scheduled for publication later this year.

Mr. Loftus is now himself the subject of Justice Department inquiries into his disclosure of possibly confidential material, according to a department official. Mr. Loftus, now in private law practice in Boston, denied releasing any material not properly cleared by intelligence authorities. 'Just Provided Records'

''I just provided Congress records they were supposed to get four years ago,'' he said. In the reopened Government investigations, the Justice Department announced last week that its criminal division was looking into the removal, apparently by the Defense Department, of certain intelligence information from at least two files in military archives.

The files were checked by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, as part of its conspiracy inquiry from early 1977 to May 1978. They dealt with two Byelorussian emigres under Justice Department investigation for atrocities in the Nazi-occupied region of western Russia. The two, Emmanuel Jasiuk and Franz Kuchel, have since died.

The tampering was discovered a year later by Mr. Loftus, who found material that the accounting office later said it had never seen. Mr. Loftus also found a note in one of the files: ''Do not disclose to G.A.O. until notified to do so.'' The note was signed only ''General Counsel'' and the Justice investigation is aimed at learning where the directive originated. One Justice Department official said the Defense Department was queried months ago but had been slow in responding. Denials From Two Departments

Both the Justice and State Departments denied last week that they had attempted to impede any investigation. The accounting office, basing its finding only on material it had been shown, concluded in May 1978 that no ''widespread conspiracy'' existed to frustrate investigations of people suspected of being war criminals. But it found that nine suspected war criminals had worked for and been paid by the Central Intelligence Agency or the State or Defense Departments.

After the disclosure last week that the files had been tampered with, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called on the accounting office to reopen its investigation and the office complied.

''It looks like we were misled,'' said John Tipton, the accounting office's senior evaluator who also headed the 1978 investigation. The withholding of the material from him last time, he said, ''would lead to the fact that there might be a conspiracy, yes.'' 'Started Making Our Contacts'

Meanwhile, he said, ''We've already started making our contacts'' for the reopened inquiry. He called the task ''pretty big - big as hell'' but said he had no idea yet how long it might take.",0,0,0,0,1,0

The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him $10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them.

However, after grossing $5.25 million from its early Thursday night showings and $28 million on its opening day, weekend projections were increased to $75–80 million. The film ended up grossing $70.4 million in its opening weekend (about $20 million less than Skyfall's $90.6 million debut, including IMAX previews), but nevertheless finished first at the box office. IMAX generated $9.1 million for Spectre at 374 screens, premium large format made $8 million from 429 cinemas, reaping 11% of the film's opening, which means that Spectre earned $17.1 million (23%) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues.

Problem:Question: In which county did the Pugh purchase an estate? Passage:In the Middle Ages Cilthriew was one of the townships in Kerry. The township is also referred to as Kilroith or Kilroyth. Richard Williams makes the claim that Cilthriew and the neighbouring house of Brynllywarch (which was also a township) were in the ownership of the Pugh (ap Hugh) family from at least 1500. A William Pugh of Kilroith is mentioned in 1632, when he purchased from Ann Foxe, widow of Somerset Foxe lands in Kilroith including Maes y Deynant William Pugh of ‘‘Kilthrew’’ was the Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1767 and his son William, who was also Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1813, became a very successful attorney and purchased the Caer Howell estate in Montgomery. His son was the notable William Pugh, an entrepreneur, who did much to develop trade and infrastructure in the Montgomeryshire Severn valley. He paid for the final extension of the Montgomery Canal from Berriew to Newtown, and for various road building schemes including a road from Abermule along the Mule valley. In Newtown he encouraged the growth of the textile industry and was responsible for the Flannel exchange, designed by Thomas Penson. In 1828 he sold the Caer Howell estate, using the proceeds to develop Brynllywarch. For this work he may have employed T G Newnham and J W Poundley as his architects and surveyors. His schemes were over ambitious and in June 1835 he fled to Caen in Normandy to escape his creditors. This resulted in the Brynllywarch and Cilthriew estates, which then consisted of 27 farms, being sold in 1839 to Richard Leyland (Bullin), a very wealthy banker from Liverpool. Leyland was to give these estates, together with the Leighton Hall Estates to his nephew John Naylor in 1846. The very detailed survey of the estates purchased by Leyland and later John Naylor, drawn up by J W Poundley, is now in the National Library of Wales. John Naylor died on13th July 1889 and the estates continued in the Naylor family ownership until about 1930, when the various farms including Cilthriew were sold.

"Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid $4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes. What is probably true about Greg?  A. He loves teaching music  B. He loves horror stories.  C. not enough information  D. He's in the Navy.

"From 3D sets, to televisions with curved screens - it may seem as if there is already a TV to suit any living room. But Google is reportedly working on screens that fit seamlessly together - potentially making the days of having to pick the perfect sized screen to fit a given space a thing of the past. The search giant said the screens would fit seamlessly together in a similar way to Lego bricks, and won't have a surrounding bezel, like current smartphones and tablets. Scroll down for video. Google is reportedly working on screens that can fit seamlessly together to create a larger ones. Its modular system would be different to video walls (illustrated) which show different images on different screens with spaces between them. Engineers at the Google X lab, in California, which is also responsible for the company’s self-driving car, are working on the new screens, The Wall Street Journal reported. It is rumoured that the screens could be put together to form different shapes, enabling users to watch films on a large widescreen, before reassembling the screen blocks to view a document in portrait format, or simply choosing to use one of them as a smaller screen. The project is at an early stage as the experts at Google try to work out how to makes screens without bezels that can connect together seamlessly, and work as one large screen. It is reportedly being led by Mary Lou Jepsen, co-founder of One Laptop Per Child. It appears that Google believes the future is likely to be modular, because the company is already working on Project Ara smartphones (pictured), where components clip together. They could be ready for consumers to buy in January. According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger phones will be able to accommodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. The phone is set to be available in January 2015 with prices starting from just $50 (£31).

"A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who ""owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country."" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

"The following article contains an answer for the question: What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert? , can you please find it?   With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an ""enemy national"", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being ""less than loyal subjects of the Tsar"". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself ""forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness"".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a ""major work"" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, ""My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg"". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (""I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come"".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an ""artist on tour"", feeding...

Doug is a dentist who cant connect with his son, and he misses his college glory days when he was called The Golden Knight. Bobby is a plumber who is henpecked by his wife and daughters while trying to follow his dream of writing a plumbing how-to book. Dudley is a computer geek who seeks to find a woman in his life. Their one collective hobby had always been to ride together on motorcycles around the city, though after college that happened less and less often.When Woody finds out that his marriage is ending in divorce and that he's bankrupt, he suggests they embark on a cross-country road trip west on their bikes to seek adventure. After some hesitation from the other three, the four agree to the trip and set off on their Harley-Davidsons.The road trip is filled with humorous moments, such as sleeping close together scantily dressed and being found by a policeman (John C. McGinley) who tells them they can be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, but it turns out that he is only teasing: he is actually jealous. Later, when the four go to a small lake, a family on a picnic joins them in the water only to realize the four men are naked. The policeman appears again; he also undresses and joins the four men, who quickly leave.The fun ends when the four stop at a bar and stumble onto a real motorcycle gang called the Del Fuegos.

Jay Glazer: ESPN disrespected him on Monday about Brett Favre news

Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer, who was first to report the buzz about the Brett Favre return this week, is unhappy with what he says is disrespectful of him and his report by ESPN this week.

Glazer, in an appearance on a Miami radio station today, said ESPN tried to discredit him and his reporting during the day on Monday. He did not identify any one individual.

Glazer was especially unhappy with what he said was a personal attack made by someone in the Monday Night Football booth during the Panthers-Giants game ESPN televised. (The MNF crew consists of Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski and Jon Gruden.)

""During the game one of those guys in the booth, I don't know which one it was,"" Glazer told WAXY-AM, ""but one of them kind of mocked it and mocked me."" (Listen to highlights of the interview here.)

The Fox Sports reporter said ESPN talent ""poo-poo-ed"" his report during the day, only to see Favre then arrive in Minnesota and sign with the Vikings on Tuesday.

""Obviously when it came true yesterday it kind of backfired on them,"" Glazer said.

Glazer reported on Monday that he was ""convinced"" Favre and the Vikings would revisit the quarterback signing on with the team. SI.com's Peter King seconded the report on Monday.

ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys responded to Glazer's remarks in an e-mail to SportsBusinessDaily today. Said Soltys, ""I don't know who he is referring to. We aggressively credited Fox Sports all day Monday on the report and Jay was praised on our air when it was officially announced.""

Glazer said he has friends at ESPN, including Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter, but said he disagrees with much of its talent.

""When you get petty and you're going to mock me or make fun or me ... don't do that with me,"" Glazer said. ""If you're going to say something, just say something that you'll be willing to say to me. Don't be petty.

""The way I go about life, if you're not willing to say it behind a 7-11 with someone, don't say it.""Hat tip: The Big Lead

The Council was convened to determine several plans for post-War Europe, including how to change borders and transfer populations in Eastern Europe and Germany.  - Austria is a federal republic made up of nine states, known in German as Länder (singular Land). Since ""Land"" is also the German word for ""country"", the term Bundesländer (""federation states""; singular Bundesland) is often used instead to avoid ambiguity. The Constitution of Austria uses both terms. In English, the term ""(Bundes)land"" is commonly rendered as ""state"" or ""province"".  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR "" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991.

He belonged to a Protestant merchant family . He took up the study of jurisprudence , and became at an early age professor of criminal law at Bonn and later in Berlin . His scholarly attachments were especially revealed in his Handbuch des gemeinen deutschen Strafrechts ( 3 vols. , 1827 -- 30 ) . Longing for faith and overcome by the conclusively and immensity of Catholic dogma , as he found it disclosed in the decrees of the Council of Trent , he converted to Catholicism in Cologne in 1824 . After the outbreak of the July Revolution in Paris , he wrote an anonymous political brochure , Die franzosische Revolution von 1830 . It met the emphatic approval of the circle of friends of the then Crown Prince ( later King Frederick William IV of Prussia ) , which was composed of men of anti-revolutionary views , influenced by Romanticism and by Karl Ludwig von Haller . Jarcke assumed the editorship of the periodical Politische Wochenblatt , founded by these men in 1831 to promote their ideas . In 1832 Metternich called him to the State Chancery in Vienna to succeed the late Friedrich von Gentz . He accepted the call , but continued an active collaborator of the weekly journal . The residence in Vienna did not satisfy him . In 1837 he broke with his Berlin friends on the subject of the `` Cologne Occurrence '' -- the imprisonment of the Archbishop of Cologne -- of which they approved but which he condemned . In 1838 he founded with George Phillips the Historisch - politische Blatter to support Catholic interests in Germany . When Metternich was overthrown in 1848 Jarcke left Vienna , but returned there when order was restored , and died shortly after . His ideal was the `` Germanic State '' of the Middle Ages ; at its head an hereditary monarch , all claims of the princes on their...  - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin.  - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic).  - Slovakia, officially the Slovak Republic, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south. Slovakia's territory spans about and is mostly mountainous. The population is over 5 million and comprises mostly ethnic Slovaks. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.  - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (""), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The Duchy of Prussia or Ducal Prussia was a duchy in eastern Prussia established during the Protestant Reformation in 1525. It was the first Lutheran duchy with a dominant German-speaking population, as well as Polish and Lithuanian minorities. In old texts and in Latin, the term ""Prut(h)enia"" refers alike to ""Ducal Prussia"", its western neighbor Royal Prussia, and their common predecessor, Teutonic Prussia. The adjectival form of the name was ""Prut(h)enic"".  - The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as ""Germania"", thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed """" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 165 of them are governed as unitary states.  - A ""metropolitan area"", sometimes referred to as a ""metro area"" or just ""metro"", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr.  - The German Revolution or November Revolution was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of Germany's Imperial government with a republic.

"Pete Maravich was born to Petar ""Press"" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach.

After injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a recluse for two years. Through it all, Maravich said he was searching ""for life"". He tried the practices of yoga and Hinduism, read Trappist monk Thomas Merton's The Seven Storey Mountain and took an interest in the field of ufology, the study of unidentified flying objects. He also explored vegetarianism and macrobiotics. Eventually, he embraced evangelical Christianity. A few years before his death, Maravich said, ""I want to be remembered as a Christian, a person that serves him [Jesus] to the utmost, not as a basketball player.""  On January 5, 1988, Maravich collapsed and died of heart failure at age 40 while playing in a pickup basketball game in the gym at First Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena, California, with a group that included evangelical author James Dobson. Maravich had flown out from his home in Louisiana to tape a segment for Dobson's radio show that aired later that day. Dobson has said that Maravich's last words, less than a minute before he died, were ""I feel great. I just feel great."" An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a rare congenital defect; he had been born with a missing left coronary artery, a vessel that supplies blood to the muscle fibers of the heart. His right coronary artery was grossly enlarged and had been compensating for the defect.  Maravich died the year after his father's passing and a number of years after his mother, who had committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot. Maravich is buried at Resthaven Gardens of Memory and Mausoleum in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

"Close to 20 inches of snow piled up at the nation's capital as a blizzard pounded mid-Atlantic states Saturday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands in the region in what the president referred to as ""Snowmaggedon."" Snow was falling from southern Indiana eastward to New York City, Washington, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. President Obama kept to his busy Washington schedule amid the swirling flakes, and ditched ""the Beast"" -- his souped-up Cadillac limousine -- for an armored, four-wheel drive Chevy Suburban capable of trudging through the several inches of snow. Despite plowing and shoveling, the continuous snow made for a slippery White House driveway. Before the 15-vehicle presidential motorcade pulled out of the driveway headed to the Capital Hilton for Obama's speech to democrats, one of the emergency vehicles lost traction and slid into an SUV. No one was in the car at the time. Flights canceled, highway crews mobilized. About 19.5 inches of snow fell at American University in Washington over two days, and was on track to possibly break a record. The capital received 28 inches of snow in the ""Knickerbocker Storm"" of January 27-28, 1922. The blizzard has left hundreds of thousands of customers from Virginia to Pennsylvania without power, utility companies said. As of 12 p.m., Dominion Virginia Power had restored electricity to 101,000 of 207,000 customers who were without power Saturday morning, the company said. In Maryland and Washington, more than 104,000 Pepco customers were in the dark, the utility company said. The majority, or 81,324, live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and 9,587 live in Washington, according to Pepco. In Philadelphia, a reported 26.7 inches had fallen at the airport by 1 p.m., the National Weather Service said. ""We are getting absolutely clobbered this morning with snow,"" said Steven Steingard, a lawyer who lives in suburban Philadelphia. ""We have about a foot already and they say it will continue for 10 to 12 hours more."" The storm also may produce a record snowfall for Baltimore, which has 21 inches of snow so far, according to the National Weather Service. Virginia snowman is taller than a house. In College Park, Maryland, snow-laden power lines drooped onto branches, causing power failures. One city resident, Ben Hampton, told CNN he could could hear electrical transformers popping. Annapolis, Maryland, had 18 inches of snow by Saturday. State officials at the briefing said 2,400 pieces of equipment were trying to clear highways. The state also was relying on 300 National Guard members to help with ongoing weather trouble. Check on traffic and road conditions. More than 750 personnel are clearing roads in Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty said. But the heavy, wet snow has even trapped some plows, Washington Department of Transportation director Gabe Klein said.

De Ruyter was born on 24 March 1607 in Vlissingen, Netherlands, as the son of beer porter Adriaen Michielszoon and Aagje Jansdochter. Little is known about De Ruyter's early life, but he probably became a sailor at the age of 11. It is said that once, when he was a child, he climbed up ladders to get to the roof of his home town's church. Not knowing that De Ruyter was there, some workers then removed the ladders.

In July 1655, De Ruyter took command of a squadron of eight (of which the Tijdverdrijf [Pastime] was his flagship) and set out for the Mediterranean with 55 merchantmen in convoy. His orders were to protect Dutch trade. Meeting an English fleet under Robert Blake along the way, he managed to avoid an incident. Operating off the Barbary Coast, he captured several infamous corsairs. After negotiating a peace agreement with Sale, De Ruyter returned home May 1656.  The same month, the States General, becoming ever more wary of Swedish King Charles X and his expansion plans, decided to intervene in the Northern Wars by sending a fleet to the Baltic Sea. The Swedes controlled this area after Charles had invaded Poland and made himself king there. De Ruyter once again embarked aboard the Tijdverdrijf, arriving at the Oresund 8 June; there he waited for Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to arrive. After Obdam had assumed command, De Ruyter and the Dutch fleet sailed to relieve the besieged city of Danzig/Gdansk on 27 July, without any bloodshed. Peace was signed a month later. Before leaving the Baltic, De Ruyter and other flag officers were granted an audience by Frederick III of Denmark. De Ruyter took a liking to the Danish king, who later became a friend.  In 1658, the States General, on the advice of a leading member (Cornelis de Graeff, one of the mayors of Amsterdam), decided to once again send a fleet to the Baltic Sea to protect the important Baltic trade and to aid the Danes against Swedish aggression, which continued despite a peace settlement. In accordance with the States' balance-of-power political approach, a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was sent, without De Ruyter, who at the time was blockading Lisbon. On 8 November, a bloody melee took place, the Battle of the Sound, which resulted in a Dutch victory, relieving Copenhagen. Still the Swedes were far from defeated and the States decided to continue their support. De Ruyter took command of a new expeditionary fleet and managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this, he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark From 1661 until 1663, de Ruyter did convoy duty in the Mediterranean.

A Therapist Is Better at Handling Emotions Than You Are

Impressive findings from the other side of the therapy couch: your therapist is better at regulating her emotions than you are, according to a small new study in the journal Psychotherapy.

The authors wanted to see if psychotherapists are better at regulating emotion than the rest of us, so they tested experienced therapists as well as non-therapists by showing them pictures designed to elicit negative emotional reactions, ranging from slightly negative images like sad people to very intense images like corpses and people with severe injuries. After each image, they rated how negative the image made them feel.

Both groups reacted the same way to the negative images.

But differences emerged during the second part of the study, when people were shown the pictures again and told to use one of two techniques that regulates emotion: either positive reappraisal, in which you reinterpret emotional information in a positive light, or distraction—thinking about something unrelated and neutral in order to disengage from the negativity. Both have been shown to be effective against negative emotions.

Therapists, the researchers found, were better at calming their emotional response by using these emotion regulation strategies than the non-therapists, regardless of which technique they chose.

“It’s something they need for that job and something that makes them be effective in what they do,” says study author Jan Pletzer, a graduate student in business administration at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany and in social and organizational psychology at the VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Next, Pletzer hopes to find out whether therapists come into their profession equipped with these emotional skills, or whether they hone them on the job.

“I suspect maybe it’s a little bit of both,” says psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord, PhD, adjunct associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study. But just because non-therapists have less training doesn’t mean they’re doomed to be less emotionally intelligent than the professionals sitting across from them.

We regulate our emotions through our thoughts, Alvord says—a key skill every good therapist learns how to do. “What lay people can do is really learn to catch your thoughts, be aware of your thoughts and recognize that those thoughts then lead to an emotional reaction and a physiological reaction,” she says. “Recognizing those connections is absolutely critical, and most people don’t. We think about emotions, but we don’t think about the thoughts and reframing and getting a different perspective.”

When we do, she says, the effects can be huge on both our mind and body. Reframe a speedbump into a positive, and “immediately you recognize that your body relaxes, your muscles aren’t as tense, you feel better and you have a better outlook for the rest of the day,” Alvord says. “It’s something that therapists learn, to catch themselves.”",0,0,0,1,0,0

"News article: Ukraine not investigating bugged phone call between US diplomats

Ukraine’s state security service said on Saturday it was not investigating the bugging of a phone call between US diplomats in which they weighed up which opposition leaders they should back for government in a reformed Ukraine.

US diplomats tried to limit the damage on Friday, after audio of the phone conversation was posted on the internet. In it, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was heard using an expletive in reference to the European Union, saying: “Fuck the EU.”

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, already furious with Washington over reports that US officials bugged her own phone, found Nuland’s remarks “totally unacceptable”, her spokeswoman said.

“The Ukrainian security service is not conducting any investigation into the matter at this time,” Maxim Lenko, a senior investigations official in the Ukrainian state security service, told a news conference in Kiev.

Nuland has been Washington’s point person on Ukraine since a crisis broke in the former Soviet republic last November, bringing thousands of protesters out on to the streets of Kiev. The bugged phone call between Nuland and the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, was released as Nuland visited Kiev to put US ideas for ending the crisis to President Viktor Yanukovich.

US officials have accused Russian intelligence of being behind a “dirty tricks” operation.

Nuland on Friday laughed off the incident saying the bugging operation was “pretty impressive tradecraft”. She said she did not think it would rebound on relations with opposition leaders, with whom western governments are trying to work as part of efforts to end Ukraine’s crisis.

"""Hollywood Hotel"" is a fast-moving, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from Warners which is sadly overlooked. It should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of Tinseltown -- ""Hooray for Hollywood."" The score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, however, including the charming ""I'm Like a Fish Out of Water,"" and ""Silhouetted in the Moonlight."" The best musical number is ""Let That Be a Lesson to You,"" in which Dick Powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves ""behind the eight-ball,"" a fate which literally befalls slow-burning Edgar Kennedy at the number's end. The picture celebrates Hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. The cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--Allyn Joslyn as a crafty press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's would-be manager, Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager, Mabel Todd as Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her even goofier dad. The ""racist"" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where Herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo-""Gone With the Wind"" sequence. It's in questionable taste, but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film, notably the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) in what I believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo. The ""Dark Eyes"" sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late, but otherwise ""Hollywood Hotel"" is a gem, well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for DVD release.

THE Obama administration’s stringent fuel efficiency standards are intended to reduce auto pollution and drive up gas mileage. They are the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight global warming. The rules worked well, at first. They no longer do. They can be fixed.

The repairs are all the more important since the Supreme Court last month put a hold on the administration’s plan to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants.

The fuel-economy standards are designed to deliver a new-car fleet averaging 54.5 m.p.g. in 2025. But this goal is in jeopardy as automakers increase the production of gas-guzzling light trucks, minivans and most S.U.V.s, which are subject to less stringent standards than other cars. These vehicles are driving up oil consumption and pollution and putting at risk American compliance with the Paris climate accord.

Two recent government reports provide ample evidence that to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the administration must strengthen the fuel-efficiency standards for those vehicles. It should also close loopholes that allow automakers to thwart the intent of the fuel standards while following the letter of the regulations.

Under the rules, fuel efficiency rose five miles per gallon from 2007 to 2013. But reports from the Environmental Protection Agency show no overall improvement in 2014 models, the most recent year for which data is available. And with the production of S.U.V.s, pickups and minivans continuing to rise, fuel efficiency and emissions for 2015 vehicles most likely grew worse, though we won’t be able to confirm that until December.

This news comes as the government begins an evaluation of the rules that could result in changes for 2021 through 2025. Our concern is that the auto industry will use the review, which it sought when the standards were first set, to delay or weaken the rules.

The fuel efficiency standards do not set overall pollution or mileage targets. Instead, they provide a sliding scale that allows for weaker mileage and emissions rules for company fleets as the automakers increase their truck production.

As a result, although the fuel economy for light trucks increased by .6 miles per gallon in 2014, the increased production of these vehicles, which rose by 5 percent, offset the overall, fleetwide benefit of other, more efficient vehicles.

In the end, the 2014 fleet of cars and trucks averaged 30.7 m.p.g., just as it did in 2013. By stalling improvements in efficiency, the auto industry continues to put the climate at risk. From well to wheels, burning a gallon of gasoline spews 25 pounds of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Of all the major automakers, American companies delivered the worst fleetwide mileage. Ford’s fuel efficiency was 9.2 m.p.g. worse than the industry leader, Mazda, which achieved 37.9 m.p.g. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler were worse than Ford. Only Honda and Hyundai were in full compliance with the standards without resorting to loopholes. One of these loopholes allows automakers to get credit for higher fuel efficiency for flexible fuel vehicles, even though those vehicles generally don’t achieve that improved efficiency.

This is auto mechanics, not rocket science. To make more efficient vehicles, carmakers can deploy existing technologies, including better engines and transmissions, and improved aerodynamics and materials. High-strength, lightweight metals have shaved 150 pounds from the average vehicle. Automakers can cut at least twice that with no impact on safety, says Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. (Our organization is affiliated with his group.)

Although automakers increased their use of fuel efficiency technology in 2014, they deployed it in only a few models, while outfitting their S.U.V.s and other light trucks with cheaper, outdated equipment. More than three-quarters of Subarus and Nissans use highly efficient continuously variable transmissions, but Ford, G.M. and Chrysler use them in only a small fraction of their fleet. BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz use turbochargers, which maximize engine efficiency, in a majority of their vehicles. Ford employs turbochargers in nearly 50 percent of its fleet, but G.M. and Chrysler have left them largely on the shelf.

And for every piece of efficient technology they ignore, automakers install another cup holder or electronic gizmo, jack up the price and increase profits by saddling buyers with a 20th-century product in 21st-century wrapping.

The Obama administration’s mileage-and-emissions program can do more than any current measure to keep greenhouse gas pollution out of the atmosphere.

One way to fix the problems that have slowed progress would be to establish a so-called backstop during the midterm review, which is just getting underway. Under it, automakers would be required to produce a fleet that cuts carbon dioxide emissions by six billion tons, achieving the administration’s original antipollution target.

The auto industry owes taxpayers that much, after the $85 billion government bailout that saved General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy.

If the rules achieve their goal, they will cut our payments at the pump, saving consumers as much as $8,000 even after they pay for the technology that delivers better mileage; ease our oil addiction; and keep six billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. We can’t afford to let automakers stop this progress.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London?, using the article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: ""I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.""Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

"Given the question: This article: Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in ""Plus blanche que la blanche hermine"" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, ""if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions"". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings ""a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.""Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?, what is it ?

"Question: Information:  - Modern humans (""Homo sapiens"", primarily ssp. ""Homo sapiens sapiens"") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - Cocculus / kkjuls / is a genus of 11 species of woody vines and shrubs , native to warm temperate to tropical regions of North America , Asia and Africa . The common name Moonseed is also used for the closely related genus Menispermum . The related Indian Berry ( Anamirta cocculus ) is known as `` Cocculus Indicus '' in pharmacology .  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Menispermaceae is a family of flowering plants. Tubocurare, a neuromuscular blocker and active ingredient in curare, is derived from plants of this family. The family contains 68 genera with some 440 species, which are distributed throughout low-lying tropical areas with some species present in temperate and arid regions.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Deciduous means ""falling off at maturity"" "" or ""tending to fall off"", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, ""deciduous"" means ""the dropping of a part that is no longer needed"" or ""falling away after its purpose is finished"". In plants it is the result of natural processes. ""Deciduous"" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).  - The lion (""Panthera leo"") is one of the big cats in the genus ""Panthera"" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: ""Panthera leo spelaea"" lived in northern and western Europe and ""Panthera leo atrox"" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the ""Old World"" from the ""New World"".  - India, officially the Republic of India (""Bhrat Gaarjya""), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Afri (singular ""Afer"") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used ""afer"" as an adjective, meaning ""of Africa"". As a substantive, it denoted a native of ""Africa"", i. e., an African.  - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus ""Vitis"".  - In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, ""lignified"" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; """") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area).  - Picrotoxin, also known as cocculin, is a poisonous crystalline plant compound, first isolated by the French pharmacist and chemist Pierre François Guillaume Boullay (17771869) in 1812. The name """"picrotoxin"""" is a combination of the Greek words """"picros"""" (bitter) and """"toxicon"""" (poison).  - Menispermum (moonseed) is a small genus of deciduous climbing woody vines in the moonseed family (Menispermaceae). Plants in this genus have small dioecious flowers, and clusters of small grape-like drupes. The name, moonseed, comes from the shape of the seed, which resembles a crescent moon. The word ""Menispermum"" is derived from the Greek words ""mene"", meaning moon, and ""sperma"" meaning seed. The common name moonseed is also applied to some other species in the related genus ""Cocculus"".  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two ""de facto"" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Anamirta cocculus is a Southeast Asian and Indian climbing plant.

"It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long ""plot summary"" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. Newsflash to the the creators: I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, I hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the Maya character, she didn't seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.

My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.  I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.  If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.  Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well.

Along with the wide array of other health complications related to smoking, it can also raise your triglycerides. The single best step smokers can take to help with an entire range of health-related conditions is to stop smoking. Cold turkey rarely works, though. Try to quit gradually by using a variety of resources, including nicotine gum and other smoking cessation aids. You can find more info at How to Quit Smoking. Burning calories can also help burn off excess triglycerides in your body to lower levels. In addition, being physically inactive (often combined with being overweight) are 2 things that increase your triglyceride levels. If you are overweight, then losing even a moderate 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) can help reduce your triglyceride levels. The American Heart Association recommends that you get 150 minutes of moderate cardio exercise each week (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise). This breaks down to 30 minutes a day and can include anything that gets your heart rate going—from jogging to sports to swimming. Some people have a sensitivity to alcohol that causes an increase in triglyceride levels. For these people, even small quantities of alcohol can raise levels, so try cutting back significantly to see if it affects your triglycerides. Unfortunately, the type of alcohol doesn’t matter.

"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: ""Hey, guy."" ""No, this is Ray."" He smiled, leaned back in his chair. It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. ""What's the problem?"" Ray asked. ""I have a recalcitrant."" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. ""Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business. To make them calcitrant."" ""I know that."" Pete sounded a little annoyed. There was some commotion in the background, a knocking on doors. Question: Where does Pete work at night? Options:  A. church  B. not enough information  C. Crossroads Detox  D. H&R Block

The woman driving (Jan Holden) is telling her boyfriend, Chris (Barry Lowe) to ""Hold on, well get help soon, were coming to the main road."" He has a large dark blister on his face. He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a ""T"" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed.

He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled.

Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house. In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunt's garden, which was locked and neglected since her accidental death ten years prior. Martha Sowerby, a maid, and her brother, Dickon, a nature-loving boy who can ""talk"" to animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the ""secret garden,"" Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually losing her sour persona and becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process. When finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing he was responsible for locking up the secret garden.

Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. 

As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.

Situated in the Outback, it is close to nothing: The cities of Adelaide and Alice Springs are respectively nine hours south and eight hours north, and the nearest town -- William Creek, official population three -- takes 3Â½ hours to reach, provided the dirt roads aren't closed due to rain. Here, the earth is red, vegetation bare and temperatures extreme, but none of that stopped Westerners from setting up camp a century ago when they found opal shimmering in the dirt.

Input: Paragraph: Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins include enzymatic changes by covalent addition of cellular regulatory determinants such as ubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) moieties. These modifications are widely used by eukaryotic cells to control the functional repertoire of proteins. Over the last decade, it became apparent that the repertoire of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation regulating various biological functions is not restricted to eukaryotic cells, but is also a feature of human virus families, used to extensively exploit complex host-cell networks and homeostasis. Intriguingly, besides binding to host SUMO/Ub control proteins and interfering with the respective enzymatic cascade, many viral proteins mimic key regulatory factors to usurp this host machinery and promote efficient viral outcomes. Advanced detection methods and functional studies of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation during virus-host interplay have revealed that human viruses have evolved a large arsenal of strategies to exploit these specific PTM processes. In this review, we highlight the known viral analogs orchestrating ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation events to subvert and utilize basic enzymatic pathways. Ubiquitinylation is an enzymatic cascade involving the covalent linkage of a small protein called ubiquitin to the amino group of a lysine residue in a substrate protein through an isopeptide bond to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin [5, 6] . Beside canonically transferring ubiquitin to a lysine residue,

"Background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Bermuda was discovered in 1503 by Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez. It is mentioned in Legatio Babylonica, published in 1511 by historian Pedro Mártir de Anglería, and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot to take on fresh meat and water. Legends arose of spirits and devils, now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the Bermuda petrel, or Cahow) and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs. Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, the archipelago became known as the Isle of Devils. Neither Spain nor Portugal tried to settle it.

"The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.  Which city will need to inspect their dams more often?  Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.

Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a ""dark soul"" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine. After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon.

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - An abbey is a complex of buildings used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe.  - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth.  - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park ("") in Gwynedd, and has been described as ""probably the busiest mountain in Britain"". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Thomas Telford FRS, FRSE (9 August 1757  2 September 1834) was a Scottish civil engineer, architect and stonemason, and a noted road, bridge and canal builder. After establishing himself as an engineer of road and canal projects in Shropshire, he designed numerous infrastructure projects in his native Scotland, as well as harbours and tunnels. Such was his reputation as a prolific designer of highways and related bridges, he was dubbed ""The Colossus of Roads"" (a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes), and, reflecting his command of all types of civil engineering in the early 19th century, he was elected as the first President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he retained for 14 years until his death.  - Aberffraw is a small village and community on the south west coast of the Isle of Anglesey, in Wales, by the west bank of the Afon Ffraw. Access by road is by way of the A4080 and the nearest rail station is Bodorgan. In the early Middle Ages Aberffraw was the capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd from c.860 AD until c.1170. Under the eponymous Aberffraw Dynasty it came to be the most important political centre in medieval Wales. The ""Llys"" remained the symbolic throne of the Kings of Gwynedd from the 9th century to the 13th century. The Royal Annals of Edward I of England show the Llys was dismantled in 1315 to provide building materials for nearby Beaumaris Castle.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - Edward I (17/18 June 1239  7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England from 1272 to 1307. He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs.  - The Menai Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge to carry road traffic between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. The bridge was designed by Thomas Telford and completed in 1826 and is a Grade I listed building.  - Britannia Bridge is a bridge across the Menai Strait between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. It was originally designed and built by Robert Stephenson as a tubular bridge of wrought iron rectangular box-section spans for carrying rail traffic. Following a fire in 1970 it was rebuilt, initially as a single tier steel truss arch bridge, carrying rail traffic. A second tier was added later and opened in 1980 to accommodate road traffic.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: ""Venedotia"" or ""Norwallia""; Middle Welsh: ""Guynet"",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.  - A tidal island is a piece of land that is connected to the mainland by a natural or man-made causeway that is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide. Because of the mystique surrounding tidal islands many of them have been sites of religious worship, such as Mont Saint-Michel with its Benedictine Abbey. Tidal islands are also commonly the sites of fortresses because of their natural fortifications.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - The Menai Strait (the ""River Menai"") is a narrow stretch of shallow tidal water about long, which separates the island of Anglesey from the mainland of Wales.  - Cribinau is a small tidal island off the south west coast of the isle of Anglesey in Wales between Porth China and Porth Cwyfan . The island is in Aberffraw Community , about 1.2 miles ( 2 km ) west of Aberffraw village . The island can be reached on foot at low tide . It is notable for the 13th - century Church in Wales church of St Cwyfan , called in Welsh : eglwys bach y mor ( `` the little church in the sea '' ) or simply Cwyfan .  - Beaumaris Castle, located in the town of the same name on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, was built as part of Edward I's campaign to conquer the north of Wales after 1282. Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Le Mont-Saint-Michel (Norman: ""Mont Saint Miché"", ) is an island commune in Normandy, France. It is located about one kilometre off the country's northwestern coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches and is in size. , the island has a population of 44.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: ""Airish Sea""), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Anglesey or Ynys Môn is an island off the north-west coast of Wales. With an area of , Anglesey is by far the largest island of Wales and the fifth-largest island in the British Isles. Anglesey is also the largest island in the Irish Sea by area, and the second most populous island in the Irish Sea (after the Isle of Man). The population at the 2011 census was 69,751. Two bridges span the Menai Strait, connecting the island to the mainland: the Menai Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford in 1826, and the Britannia Bridge.  - The Angles were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name ""England"". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein.

Movie title: Imitation General Context: It's 1944, in France, during WWII. In the aftermath of a big battle, scattered American ground troops find themselves disorganized and surrounded on all sides by German forces. Cut off from their company, and without a radio, U. S. Army Brigadier-General Charles Lane (Kent Smith), MSgt. Murphy Savage (Glenn Ford) and Cpl. Chan Derby (Red Buttons) come upon a group of five leaderless soldiers. After their shock of seeing a general out in the field, they accept Lane's encouragement and orders to set about trying to find help and work their way out of their situation. The general decides that a nearby, mostly intact farmhouse, will serve at their headquarters. He orders the five men to fan out and find any other stragglers they can, sending any officers and non-coms to him at the farmhouse.While checking to make sure the farmhouse is safe, Cpl. Derby comes upon a beautiful young French woman, Simone (Taina Elg), inside taking a bath. Simone is none too happy to see him inside her home, but it's also odd that she'd be all alone, in an unlocked and war-damaged farmstead, taking a bath. General Lane comes into the main room of the farmhouse and asks Derby what's going on. He explains that there's a naked woman in the other room. They wait for her to come out and attempt to calm her down and explain what they are doing there.Lane realizes, upon examining his map, that they are in the middle of a two-mile gap in the American line. Although Simone, who speaks no English, blames the Allied bombings for the destruction of her farm and the nearby local village, she grudgingly allows the men to set up an impromptu command post. She is very happy when the men offer her some C-rations.Murph and Derby are surprised by Lane's determination to remain in the field, to organize and lead a new offensive to plug that two-mile gap.

"Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; ""dime"" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while ""eagle"" and ""mill"" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, ""paper money"" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the ""double eagle"", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as ""fractional currency"", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as ""shinplasters"". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a ""Union"", ""Half Union"", and ""Quarter Union"", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.

"Summarize the following movie reviews:

1. ""Inside Out"" is uplifting and magical, impeccably crafted and cinematically arresting, emotional and humorous beyond measure.
2. What makes the movie so rich and enlightening, even for an adult well acquainted with their own blue periods, is the depiction of emotions not as at war with each other but rather in a constant juggling act to keep their human going.
3. Once again, Pixar delivers a movie aimed at the young ones while delivering a strong message to the adults. [full review in Spanish]
4. Full of color and optimism, this is an extraordinary take on the human mind. [full review in Spanish]
5. From top to bottom, Inside Out is Pixar's best film since Ratatouille.
6. A work of nifty craftsmanship and considerable complexity beneath its unassuming surface.
7. The Pixar craftsmanship is as brilliant as always, and the emotions that it will bring out in adults, if not the children, are as powerful and as surprising as ever from an animated film.
8. The year is only half over but the sheer originality and soul in ""Inside Out"" easily puts it as one of 2015's best films. A definite must-see for the whole family.
9. Inside Out gets a bit frantic every now and then, but most of the film is sweet, funny and a visual knockout. You don't need to take a child to enjoy it.
10. The magnificent head trip that is Inside Out does more than take us inside a young girl's mind. It also restores Pixar's lost magic.

"The cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm.

"Smart Exercise 

Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 /ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: ""While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain."" 

The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. ""Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,"" says Margaret. 

Older people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time. 

For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week.

1. Are doctors starting to think there is a connection between exercise and brain development?
2. What does judy Cameron's research say about the topic?
3. Can exercise cause physical changes in the brain?

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I’ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers. Who were the study volunteers?

"Article: It seems more and more Americans want schools to teach foreign languages to children younger than five years old.The most popular way to teach these young children another language is called immersion  . Children in immersion programs hear only the new language in the classroom.The children play games, sing songs and talk to one another in the new languages, some experts   say immersion programs are the most effective   way for young children to learn a language.But there can be a problem when children in the United States begin to learn another language at such an early age.Not many elementary schools continue to teach a foreign language.Only seven of the fifty states require   schools to teach a foreign language to students between the ages of six and twelve.Language experts say it is easier for younger children to learn a language.Still, American schools generally do not begin to teach foreign languages until secondary schools.By then, students are about thirteen years old.

"Arashi (Lan , lit. Storm) is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny & Associates talent agency. The members are Ohno Satoshi, Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999. The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles--beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases.

Arashi began 2002 by releasing their first single under J Storm. ""A Day in Our Life"" was used as the theme song for Sakurai's comedy drama Kisarazu Cat's Eye and debuted atop of the Oricon weekly singles chart selling 226,480 copies. Their subsequent releases of the year, ""Nice na Kokoroiki"" and ""Pikanchi"", were used as the theme songs for the anime Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Koen-mae Hashutsujo and Arashi's movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakedo Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakedoHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard But Happy) respectively.  Starting in 2003, the group would only release two singles every year until 2007. Both singles released in 2003, ""Tomadoi Nagara"" and ""Hadashi no Mirai/Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono"", debuted at number two on the charts. The song ""Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono"" marked the first time a member contributed to the penning of a single, as many of the group's songs are produced by other lyricists, composers, or musicians. Sakurai, who is the designated rapper of Arashi, has since written all the incorporated rap lyrics of the group's releases.  2004 was Arashi's fifth anniversary since debut. They began the year by releasing their twelfth single, ""Pikanchi Double"", in February as the theme song for their second movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakara Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakaraHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard Thus Happy). Selling 89,106 copies in the first week, it is Arashi's lowest-selling single to date. In celebration of their anniversary, the group released a greatest hits album 5x5 The Best Selection of 2002-2004, which included their second 2004 single ""Hitomi no Naka no Galaxy/Hero"".  In 2005, on New Year's Day, Arashi released their first concert DVD since How's It Going? in 2003 titled 2004 Arashi! Iza, Now Tour!!. From July 26 to August 24, they embarked on a summer tour titled One to support their album of the same name. One of the highlights of the tour included the live performance their first single of the year, ""Sakura Sake"", on top of ""Johnny's Moving Stage"" (ziyanizumubingusutezi, Janizu Mubingu Suteji), a transparent stage that travels over the top of the audience. Invented by Matsumoto, ""Johnny's Moving Stage"" has since been used in a majority of Arashi's concerts to allow them to move closer to the audience seated at a distance from the main stage. In November, Arashi released a theme song for the manga-based drama Hana Yori Dango, which starred Matsumoto as one of the lead actors. ""Wish"" went on to sell an estimated 178,000 copies in its first week and over 300,000 copies by the end of its chart run, making it their first single to sell over 300,000 copies in total in nearly three years since ""A Day in Our Life"" in 2002.

The religion's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized. The Watch Tower Society's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so, but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family. The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah's Witnesses within their organization since 1950, ""not one was reported by the church to secular authorities."" William Bowen, a former Jehovah's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion, has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities, and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its ""crime-free"" reputation. In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court, reportedly paying as much as $780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing.

The situation becomes even more difficult to cover up considering that Tyler is being constantly blown off by Nick, due to Nick's efforts at chasing Julie Gunn, as well as Nick having to make a science project to graduate high school and reptile-like aliens that have begun to appear and pursue Tyler. After having literally no one left to turn to, Tyler decides to tell agent Armstrong about the UFO. After agent Armstrong explains to Tyler about the effects that his trip into space had on his body, he shoots the ship with a laser gun, thereby critically damaging it, before he reveals himself to Tyler as a reptile-like alien in disguise and captures him. Nick, feeling guilty for constantly doubting and ignoring Tyler, goes to the UFO hideout to try to apologize. Upon finding that Tyler is missing and the UFO damaged, he begins an attempt to repair the UFO.

Title: Very Poor Literary Example Review: I am a first grade teacher and I beg you to NOT get any of these books. They are a terrible example for children learning to write. One of the many strategies I teach my students to use while spelling and writing is to ask themselves, ""Does it look right?"" because so much of what is taught is reinforced by exposure and experience. With the MTH books being such poor examples of grammar, sentence structure, and story development, what these children are learning (or un-learning) is detrimental. What in the world were the editor and author thinking??? They should be ashamed. I came on to write an honest review because there are so many that praise this series and I am glad to see there are people who realize how important correct grammar and syntax are in children's literature.

"U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

"Summarize this article:

John Romero and Adrian Carmack are seeking $700,000 (Â£480,000) on Kickstarter to make a game called Blackroom.
The futuristic game will be set in a ""holographic simulation gone rogue"".
In a video, Mr Romero said the game would hark back to the original Doom, being ""visceral, varied and violent"" .
Mr Romero and Mr Carmack are two of the four people that founded games company iD, which created Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake and many others. John Carmack (unrelated to Adrian) who was iD's lead programmer, currently works for Facebook on its Oculus virtual reality headset.
The summary on Kickstarter explained that Blackroom would use its holographic setting to let players fight in many different environments including ruined Victorian mansions, Wild West ghost towns and pirate galleons. In-game tools would let players ""hack"" the environment in line with its holographic theme.
It would also feature the extensive gunplay seen in older titles and let players use circle-strafing and rocket jumping to take down opponents in single and multi-player maps.
Software tools that let players create their own maps and modifications for the game would also be available at launch.
Mr Romero said the project had been in the planning stages for some time and he had set up a company, Night Work Games, in Galway, Ireland to handle its development.
The game will be released in late 2018 for both Windows and Mac computers.
Sam Machkovech from tech news site Ars Technica gave the funding campaign a cautious welcome but added: ""This is the era of Kickstarter fatigue and, as such, more hard gameplay details might assure fans that Romero is not repeating his over-promising mistakes of old.""

Instead, sport host will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations   on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product), or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations. CCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the ""purity"" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice. Fu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who suggested the change. ""Firstly, using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,"" he said. ""Then, using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English.

"Q:Something strange was unbelievable. Take Robert for example. After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life. His family especially his wife did their best to tend and comfort him. By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough(  )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock. What was Edwards doing when he was struck by the lightning? A) Hiding from the rain under a tree. B) Driving a car. C) Taking a walk D) lying on the ground

"Question: Article: It is often necessary to release a fish, that is, set it free after catching, because it is too small, or you just don't want to take it home to eat. In some cases, releasing fish is a good measure that will help keep fish variety and build their population size. The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) encourages fishermen who practice catch-and-release fishing to use a few simple skills when doing so. The advice provided below will help make sure that the fish you release will survive   to bite again another day. --When catching a fish, play it quickly and keep the fish in the water as much as possible. Don't' use a net in landing the fish and release it quickly to prevent it from dying. --Hold the fish gently. Do not put your fingers in its eyes. Don't wipe the scales   off the   fish because it might cause it to develop a disease and reduce its chance of survival. --Remove your hook   quickly. If the hook is too deep or hooked in the stomach, cut the   line and leave the hook in. The hook left inside will cause no serious problem to the fish. --Take good care of the fish by moving it gently in water . Release the fish when it begins to   struggle and is able to swim. --Do not hold fish in a bucket or some other containers and later decide to release it. If you are   going to release a fish, do so right away. With a little care and by following the suggestions given above, you can give the released fish a better chance of survival.

"So my family and I went to this restaurant tonight due to an article that was written in our local paper about it. Raved as one of the top 100 chinese restaurants in the nation.  I am not sure what nation they are talking about but I get better food at my neighborhood PF Chang's.  Atmosphere is nice but the kitchen is too open, you can hear all the noise.  They play constant whistle/flute music, which would be calming, however they play it at too loud of volume so it comes across as more annoying than calming.  The soda machine is right by the tables so they were filling the ice while we were eating and it was very loud.  We were seated right away but then proceeded to wait about 10 mins before being approached by anyone.  Not only were we ready with our drink order by the time the server arrived, we had read the menu and decided on our food as well.  The food took quite a while to come out of the kitchen despite only having a few diners there.  The appetizer of lettuce wraps was boring and non flavorful, served with only 4, non appetizing almost all white iceberg lettuce leaves, the non green part I usually throw out and the price of $9.99 was ridiculous.  We ordered 3 entrees, all tasted the same, which was like nothing.  I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.    I will say a couple of good points were the beef, chicken and seafood they used were of good quality.  The scallops were very large, beef tender with no fat or toughness and the chicken was the same.  However it was hard to enjoy due to none of it having any flavor.  I was hoping the reviews I read about the food being bland on the way to the restaurant were wrong but they were right on point.  Dinner was about $65.00 with tip for 3 of us, that was only 3 entrees and 1 sad appetizer...I paid less taking my daughter and a friend to BJ's, got a ton more food and it was much more delicious.  One last note, tables are too close together.  I enjoy a dining experience without having people right next to me, which is how some of the tables are here.  One long bench against one wall but with tables and chairs lined up.  I will take a private booth any day!  This is the first review I have ever written for a restaurant so for me to take the time, you know I am speaking the truth!  Save your money people, I will be spending mine somewhere else.

"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say ""No I can't"".  Question: Who is  Timmek's daughter? Movie title: World Without End Movie plot: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The ""mutates"" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance). Elain (Shirley Patterson), admires a shirtless Herbert Ellis, commenting that the astronauts are ""more muscular than our men"". Deena (Lisa Montell),...

"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: How you end a computer session depends on how you use the computer, your views on energy conservation , and what you have been told about how your decision will affect your investment's longevity: will frequent starting and stopping cause its circuits  to burn out sooner? Rest easy, your computer is more likely to be damaged by a virus picked up from the Internet than by being turned off and on too much. They are also energyefficient: such efficiency has reached the point where most computers place themselves in sleep mode if they remain idle  for a certain period of time. So your computer will likely slip into sleep mode anyway, even if you leave it on overnight. Sleep mode itself, once a pretty unreliable option--you never knew if you would be able to wake your computer without having to reboot   it--has been vastly improved with newer operating systems. If you want your computer to consume as little energy as possible when not in use, shut it down. If you want it to consume zero energy, you're going to have to unplug (......) it. Your computer can be in only three states: on, sleep or off--each of which draws some level of electric current. A computer that is ""on"" will either be actively processing  information or sitting idle, depending on whether the user is typing a document, reading an email or has stepped away briefly. The amount of wattage   drawn when the computer is on varies greatly depending on whether it is a laptop or a desktop computer. The latter uses more energy because desktop power supplies are less efficient and require a separate and often larger, powerhungry monitor. It also varies based on the type of work being done: complex calculations requiring intensive processing are more powerhungry, whereas writing or Web browsing consumes far less electricity. Options: A It will consume as little energy as possible. B It is more likely to be damaged by a virus picked up from the Internet. C It will have to be rebooted when used again. D It has to be shut down and unplugged. Answer: C It will have to be rebooted when used again. Question:

By. Jennifer Newton. An Indian official has mocked questions over the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls telling journalists 'What's it to you?' Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made the comments as police announced they had made a fifth arrest in the case, which saw the two girls attacked and then hanged from a tree in the state. It has also been revealed that two police officers have also been fired for failing to investigate when one of the girl's fathers reported them as missing. Scroll down for video. The mother of one of the gang-rape and murder victims in India mourns her daughter. The distraught father of one of the victims covers his face in despair after his daughter was raped and then hanged from a tree. Police escort one of the girls' mothers to the scene where the victims were discovered in Katra in Uttar Pradesh state. Sheer horror: Two teenage girls were found hanging from a tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were allegedly raped and killed by a gang of men - including at least one police officer. 'Then why are you worried? What's it to you?' he added. Officers Malik says the fifth arrest in the case came early today with police facing growing criticism for a series of rapes in Uttar Pradesh state, which has a long reputation for lawlessness. The three other men arrested are cousins in their 20s from an extended family, and face murder and rape charges, they added. But in a country with a long history of tolerance for sexual violence, the firings yesterday and the minister's comments were not a surprise to many in India. People in New Delhi march in protest against the government of Uttar Pradesh, where the two girls were found hanged after being gang raped. Protesters carried placards demanding the immediate arrest of all of those accused in the gang rape case. Untouchables: The family belongs to the Dalit community, also called 'untouchables' and considered the lowest rung in India's age-old caste system. Last month Mr Yadav's father, a former chief minister and head of the state's ruling party also told an election rally that the party opposed a law calling for gang rapists to be executed. 'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.' Kavita Krishnan, a women's rights activist, said such comments make clear to police that rape isn't taken seriously by officials. She called the chief minister' comments 'a trivialisation of rape.' The gang rape, with video of the girls' corpses hanging from a mango tree and swaying gently in a breeze, was the top story Friday on India's relentless 24-hour news stations. Official statistics say about 25,000. rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. But activists say that number is very low, since women are often. pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults. Indian. police and politicians, who for decades had done little about sexual. violence, have faced growing public anger since the December 2012. gang-rape and murder of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an. attack that sparked national outrage over the treatment of women. On Friday, the state's former chief minister lashed out at the ruling government. Outrage: The attack is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent years sparking protests across the country. Mayawatie, who only uses one name said: 'There is no law and order in the state. It is the law of the jungle. Hours. later, the chief minister ordered that suspects in the attack be tried. in special ""fast track"" courts, to get around India's notoriously slow. judicial system. The girls, who were 14 and 15, were raped in the tiny village of Katra, about 180 miles from Lucknow. Police say they disappeared Tuesday night after going into fields since their house has no toilet. The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help. When. the bodies were discovered the next day, angry villagers silently. protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut. down from the tree. The villagers allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday. The girls were Dalits, from the community once known as ""untouchables"" in India's ancient caste system. While. sexual assaults are reported across India, there have been a string of. high-profile attacks in just the past few days in Uttar Pradesh. On Thursday, police arrested three men for brutally attacking the mother of a rape victim after she refused to withdraw her complaint. The attack, in the town of Etawah, followed the May 11 rape of the woman's teenage daughter. A local man was arrested after the mother filed a complaint with authorities. Five men - including the father, a brother and a cousin of the man accused in the rape - followed the victim's mother away from her house on Monday and beat her relentlessly, demanding she drop the accusation, he said. Dinesh Kumar, the town's police superintendent. The mother was in critical condition in a hospital, with numerous broken bones and internal injuries. Police arrested three men Thursday for the attack and were looking for two others. On Wednesday, a 17-year-old woman was attacked in a field and raped by four men in south western Uttar Pradesh, police said. One man has been arrested.

Throughout 2014, Wiggs traveled from her home in Brooklyn, New York to Dayton, Ohio, near where Macpherson and both Deals lived. The group began practicing new material in Kim Deal's basement, including compositions by her and one by Wiggs. By August, there were three new songs they could play well, two less so, and others they had not yet practiced. Reported titles were ""Skinhead #2"", ""Simone"", ""All Nerve"", and ""Launched"". The band Neutral Milk Hotel asked the Breeders to open for them at a Hollywood Bowl concert to be held on September 18. The latter decided to go on tour leading up to this show and to perform some new compositions in preparation for their eventual recording.

But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don't seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including ""Sandy Claws"" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they're taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs. The evil scientist must whip up some reindeer, Halloweentown's top trick-or-treaters are to kidnap Sandy Claws, and Sally's task is to make Jack a red Santa suit. She tries to tell him that co-opting Christmas is a terrible idea, but he's too wrapped up in his enthusiasm to listen.The three trick-or-treaters return triumphantly with the Easter Bunny; Jack sends them back and eventually they bring him Sandy Claws (who surprises Jack by having hands rather than claws).

– After the Pearl Harbor attack, Anthony Acevedo was determined to defend his homeland—which meant returning to it. Acevedo was born in 1924 in California to Mexican parents who were deported 13 years later; he and his siblings went to Mexico, too, and he re-entered the US at age 17 to join the Army. In October 1944, Acevedo found himself a medic in Europe. Just a few months later, at the Battle of the Bulge, he was captured, and began a journal that would end up being hugely significant, one that's coming back into view in the wake of Acevedo's Feb. 11 death at age 93. Acevedo was one of 350 ""undesirables,"" US soldiers that included Jews and were sent to the slave labor camp at Buchenwald known as Berga in February 1945, reports CNN. Half the soldiers sent there didn't make it out alive, and Acevedo journaled every US death he observed, as well as horrors experienced there, including his own: being made to fill the bullet holes left in the heads of dead soldiers with wax to mask the shootings. He told CNN in 2008 that dandelion leaves were a ""gourmet meal"" compared to their normal rations: soup cooked from rats and cats, and bread made from sawdust, ground glass, and barley. The Press-Enterprise reports he weighed just 87 pounds by April 1945. CNN notes that the US didn't recognize the ordeal of the soldiers kept at Berga until Acevedo went public with his story in 2008.

In the surprisingly festive afterlife, Victor learns that his new fiancee's name is Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and that she was murdered in the woods on the night of her elopement.Victor, wanting to get back to Victoria, convinces the magical Elder Gutknecht (Michael Gough) to send him and Emily temporarily to the Land of the Living under the pretext of introducing Emily to Victor's parents. Once back home, Victor rushes to see Victoria and confesses his love. Emily feels betrayed and drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead.Victoria tells her parents that Victor is in trouble, but they believe she has lost her mind and lock her up in her bedroom. She attempts to escape, but to no avail. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents plan to marry her off to a presumably wealthy stranger named Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant).Emily is devastated at first by Victor's deceit, but eventually realizes that Victor and Victoria probably belong together. Victor apologizes to Emily for lying to her.Victor's recently deceased coachman appears in the afterlife and tells him about Victoria's impending wedding to Lord Barkis. Victor, feeling betrayed, decides to end his own life so he can properly marry Emily. The dead go ""upstairs"" to the Land of the Living to hold Victor and Emily's wedding in the town church. At first, the living are terrified, but their fear dissipates once they recognize...

"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem?  The ""State Anthem of the Russian Federation"" (Russian: Госуда́рственный гимн Росси́йской Федера́ции, tr. Gosudarstvennyj gimn Rossijskoj Federacii, IPA: [ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ˈɡʲimn rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨj])  is the name of the official national anthem of Russia. It uses the same music as the ""State Anthem of the Soviet Union"", composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem.  From 1944, that earliest version replaced ""The Internationale"", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem.  The same melody, but without lyrics mentioning dead Stalin by name, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism. The Russian SFSR was the only constituent republic of the Soviet Union without its own regional anthem. The lyric-free ""Patrioticheskaya Pesnya"", composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia and confirmed in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted. Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and it became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a new...

"Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form...

My best story is about Santa Claus. A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, answer the following question. The doctors probably spent how long trying to save Santa?

Although I found A Fine Balance to be the most moving and brilliantly contructed novel I have ever read, I preferred this book as it didn't tear me apart emotionally as much as AFB. I adored the characters and was touched by the protagonist's kindness towards Tehmul when he (SPOILER) discovers the whereabouts of the doll.

"Q: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

"Question: Information:  - The Duchy of Normandy grew out of the 911 Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, leader of the Vikings. From 1066 until 1204 it was held by the kings of England, except for the brief rule of Robert Curthose (10871106) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (11441150). Normandy was declared forfeit by Philip II of France in 1202, and seized by force of arms in 1204. It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, when the English sovereigns ceded their claim, except for the Channel Islands.  - Normandy (pronounced , Norman: ""Normaundie"", from Old French ""Normanz"", plural of ""Normant"", originally from the word for ""northman"" in several Scandinavian languages) is one of the regions of France, roughly corresponding to the historical Duchy of Normandy.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - France is divided into 18 administrative regions, including 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions. The 13 metropolitan regions (including 12 mainland regions and Corsica) are each further subdivided into 2 to 13 departments, while the overseas regions consist of only one department each and hence are also referred to as ""overseas departments"". The current legal concept of ""region"" was adopted in 1982, and in 2016 what had been 27 regions was reduced to 18.  - Brittany ( pronounced or ; Gallo: ""Bertaèyn"", pronounced ) is a cultural region in the north-west of France. Covering the western part of Armorica, as it was known during the period of Roman occupation, Brittany subsequently became an independent kingdom and then a duchy before being united with the Kingdom of France in 1532 as a province governed as if it were a separate nation under the crown. Brittany has also been referred to as ""Less"", ""Lesser"" or ""Little"" Britain (as opposed to ""Great Britain""). It is bordered by the English Channel to the north, the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Bay of Biscay to the south. Its land area is 34,023 km² .  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Jurisdiction of Guernsey is a possession of the Crown in right of Guernsey in the English Channel , off the coast of Normandy . The jurisdiction embraces not only all ten parishes on the island of Guernsey , but also the much smaller inhabited islands of Herm , Jethou and Lihou together with many small islets and rocks . The jurisdiction is not part of the United Kingdom , however defence and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government . The whole jurisdiction lies within the Common Travel Area of the British Isles and is not a member of the European Union , but has a special relationship with it , being treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods . Taken together with the separate jurisdictions of Alderney and Sark it forms the Bailiwick of Guernsey . The two Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey together form the geographical grouping known as the Channel Islands .  - The English Channel (""the Sleeve"" [hence ] ""Sea of Brittany"" ""British Sea""), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - Lihou is a small tidal island located just off the west coast of the island of Guernsey, in the English Channel, between Great Britain and France. Administratively, Lihou forms part of the Parish of St. Peter's in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and is now owned by the Parliament of Guernsey (officially known as the States of Guernsey), although there have been a number of owners in the past. Since 2006, the island has been jointly managed by the Guernsey Environment Department and the Lihou Charitable Trust. In the past the island was used by locals for the collection of seaweed for use as a fertiliser, but today Lihou is mainly used for tourism, including school trips. Lihou is also an important centre for conservation, forming part of a Ramsar wetland site for the preservation of rare birds and plants as well as historic ruins of a priory and a farmhouse.  - Jethou is a small island that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is privately leased, and not open to the public.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the ""Old World"" from the ""New World"".  - The Bailiwick of Guernsey is one of three Crown dependencies of the United Kingdom.  - The Channel Islands (Norman: ""Îles d'la Manche"", French: ""Îles Anglo-Normandes"" or ""Îles de la Manche"") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively.

"Question: ""Who did the Crusaders come before?""  Context: ""The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.""  Answer:

Trying to get out of the rain, they came to the front desk hoping to get some shelter for the night. ""Could you possibly give us a room here?"" the husband asked. The clerk, a friendly man with a winning smile, looked at the couple and explained that there were three conventions in town.""All of our rooms are taken,"" the clerk said.""But I can't send a nice couple like you out into the rain at one o'clock in the morning. Would you perhaps be willing to sleep in my room? It's not exactly a suite, but it will be good enough to make you folks comfortable for the night.""

"Please answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.  Woman: Excuse me. Is this seat taken?  Man: It is now. Take a seat.  Woman: Thanks. I had been waiting for over two hours for the bus to come.  Man: Yeah. The bus broke down about 50 miles back. Actually, the bus driver lost control of the bus when he split hot chocolate on himself, and then as he tried to regain control of the bus, he hit a rock and the bus blew a tire.  Woman: Uh. Are you sure this bus in safe?  Man: I'm not sure if it's safe, but you can't beat the price of the trip.  Woman: So, where are you from?  Man: To tell the truth, I really don't know.  Woman: Uh, what do you mean?  Man: Well, you see, I was adopted when I was a baby. I was told that I was born in New York City, but I can't be sure about that. Then, my new parents raised me in a small town Texas. I'm sure you've never heard of it.  Woman: Oh.  Man: My parents, Fred and Norma, had a farm, so I grew up milking cows and herding sheep. Actually, I'm on my way to visit them now.  Woman: You mean back to Texas?  Man: Oh no. They sold that farm years ago when they discovered oil on their property. They live on a ranch right outside of Las Vegas. Beautiful place with a pool ...  Woman: Las Vegas. Las Vegas? I thought this bus was heading to Chicago ... in the opposite direction!  Man: Ah. You're on the wrong bus.  Woman: I got to get off.  Man: Hey, relax. Spend a weekend with me and my parents on the ranch. I can teach you how to milk a cow or something.  Woman: I have to get off.  Man: Relax. Anyway, once this bus left the station, it ain't gonna stop until the next stop ... three hours from now. The driver got really upset when the last passenger made a similar mistake.

"This is really about a New Years Eve experience, and lack of organization. There are dozens of high end Steakhouses to choose from in Las Vegas, but most serve a set menu on NYE. I had called ahead to see if the entire menu was available at Gallagers I was assured it was, so that's were I chose to eat. have often eaten at the one in NYC on NYE and it was great.  I made a reservation for 7:15. We weren't seated until 7:45. Then were told we had to choose from a limited menu- and no substitutions on sides. And each steak came with something different. I was told by the manager that we had been given wrong information. We should have left then, but it was getting late and we had tickets to a show.. Then the food took 50 minutes to arrive!! We had to rush through a very expensive meal, and asked for the check before we were even done. Everyone in the restaurant was very upset as they were dealing with the same issues. The food finally arrived, and it was very good, but overall such a bad experience I don't think I will come back. We have often eaten at the restaurant in NYC on NYE, and it was very organized and delicious. This place was chaos. It's probably fine on regular evenings, but this was a very disappointing dining experience.

"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in.

Plot title: Spider-Man Movie plot: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school senior in New York City. His parents are dead and he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). He has a crush on his next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is also one of the few classmates who is nice to him. Her boyfriend, Flash (Joe Manganiello) and his buddies pick on him. Peter's only friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco), who, though rich and good-looking, is similarly an outcast. Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the head of weapons contractor Oscorp, appreciates Peter's scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son.Peter's science class takes a field trip to a genetics laboratory at Columbia University. The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter. Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists, Dr. Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the formula. He gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp inventions, an exoskeleton and jet glider.Peter wakes up the next morning feeling better than ever. He also learns his scrawny physique now ripples with muscles and his eyesight is perfect. At school that day, he learns he can shoot webs out of spinnerettes in his wrists.

"Matthew Macklin was sore, obviously heartbroken, but gracious in defeat. A thunderous right hook from Jorge Sebastien Heiland of Argentina had knocked him out in the 10th round of their WBC world middleweight title eliminator at the 3 Arena on Saturday night. He is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title. A student of boxing, he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name-checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters. He deserves access to that club. ‘Look at the [Jake] LaMottas and all them — they lost many, many times and still went on and won a world title,’ said Macklin in his dressing-room after the fight. ‘How many footballers have bad games? It’s just in boxing you’re as good as your last fight. Matthew Macklin could be nearing retirement after suffering a devastating defeat in Dublin. ‘It’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it’s just not to be for me. Maybe that fight in Germany will haunt me forever.’ That fight in Germany was a reference to his 2011 points loss to Felix Sturm in Cologne in a WBA world-title fight. He was awarded the decision by German TV pundits that night, but the judges, bafflingly, awarded the win to Sturm. In hindsight, it was his best opportunity to win a world title, despite the fact that he went on to headline at Madison Square Garden against Sergio Martinez and later challenged pound-for-pound monster Gennady Golovkin. Now it seems likely that this could be the end for the two-time European champion after his sixth career loss brings his record to 31-6. Macklin was stopped by Jorge Sebastien Heiland in the 10th round of their WBC world title eliminator. Heiland and Macklin went toe to toe for 10 rounds. After a clean left hand landed on Macklin’s chin, that right hook from Heiland left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round. In truth, the Birmingham-born Tipperary man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look, for the first time, a very tired fighter. ‘He was decent and I knew he was good,’ said Macklin of Heiland afterwards. ‘No one wants to admit they’re getting older but the pace of the fight… it probably suited him more than me.’ A constantly busy 27-year-old Heiland was too much to deal with. Argentine Heiland celebrates victory over Macklin in Dublin on Saturday night. ‘I’ve got the sort of face where I show every emotion anyway, so I looked tired after a round!” laughed Macklin afterwards, but the 32-year-old is now, undoubtedly, considering retirement. ‘I’ve had tough fights, tough spars and lived in f***ing hotel rooms all over the world! It’s a tough-ish life, but I’ve had more highs than lows, definitely.... I’ll just have to see.’ The unusual predicament Macklin finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an All-Ireland showdown with Limerick’s Lee or a date with England’s Martin Murray. Promoter Eddie Hearn pinpointed Dublin middleweight Luke Keeler as a star in the making after the 27-year-old demolished Gary Boulden in one round, while he hinted that Cork’s Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered Anthony Fitzgerald inside two minutes. Former amateur stars John Joe Nevin and Tommy McCarthy both recorded early stoppage wins.

Federal Diary Live

Trying to figure out which ""lifecycle"" fund might meet your needs in the Thrift Savings Plan? Interested in TSP efforts to lower plan costs while improving services to participants?

Gary A. Amelio, executive director at the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, joins The Post's Stephen Barr, who writes the Federal Diary column, to take your questions about the TSP.

Before joining the thrift board, which oversees the TSP, Amelio served as senior vice president and managing director of the retirement and investment services department at PNC Bank. Amelio has more than 20 years of banking experience in employee benefits, executive compensation, tax and fiduciary areas. He is a 1978 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and in 1981 earned a degree from the university's law school.

Stephen Barr: Thanks to all joining in this important discussion today about the TSP and its future. A special thanks to Gary Amelio, the thrift board's executive director, for taking time from his busy schedule. To get this discussion rolling, Mr. Amelio, would you tell us what ""lifecycle funds"" are, and, as a follow up, what you think they will mean for the typical TSP participant? Again, thanks for joining us today.

Gary Amelio: You are welcome, Steve. Always glad to join with your readers. You inquired about the lifecycle funds. They are a marvelous new feature that will be available to participants in just a few weeks. Lifecycle funds are asset allocation models which hold the five existing TSP funds i.e. G, F, C, S & I Funds. They are allocated based upon the participants time horizon to their ultimate retirement and withdrawal date. For example, a participant who is 60 years old and will retire and begin withdrawing assets in two years will have an allocation heavily weighted towards the G & F funds. A 19 year old soldier who is perhaps 45 years from retiring and withdrawing assets will have a lifecycle allocation which is heavily weighted towards the C, S & I equity funds. As that soldier progresses towards his/her time horizon the investments will automatically re-allocate to more holdings in the G F funds.

I am a 29-year-old who has been with the federal government for two years. I have always invested the maximum in my TSP, but I am not sure what fund would work best. As a result, my funds are lagging in G. What are the pros and cons of lifecycle funds for me?

Gary Amelio: There is significant upside potential to your using a lifecycle fund. Investment experts recommend investing on the efficient frontier, and this is as close and effortless as you can get to this concept in the TSP. In your case at age 29 you have a time horizon which would be roughly 30 years or more so you would be looking at the 2040 lifecycle fund. The major advantage is that your assets will be rebalanced daily and reallocated quarterly to maintain your investments on the efficient frontier. This will be done for you at no additional cost and you need do nothing, other than continue to make contributions to the plan.

Fairfax, Va.: With the life cycle fund, do you recommend putting 100 percent of your contributions into it or treating like another fund by putting, for example, 20 percent in it?

Gary Amelio: This is a GREAT question. All investment experts recommend that you invest 100% of your account balance in the 1 single lifecycle fund that best fits your circumstances. Any other use of the TSP funds may result in less than optimal returns, a higher amount of risk in your portfolio or both.

Will there be management fees incurred with these new fund offerings?

Gary Amelio: There is no additional cost to participants in utilizing the lifecycle funds. The fees for the underlying G, F, C, S & I funds are the only fees that apply to TSP participants.

Arlington, Va.: Thanks for being here, Mr. Amelio. I understand that TSP now has no more open seasons and that the maximum contribution has changed. Would you please provide us with a quick update?

Gary Amelio: The TSP has no more open seasons, a change made by legislation effective July 1st of this year. This change benefits the participants who are now able to change the amounts of their contributions on a current basis. The percentage limitations on contributions will be lifted in 2006, pursuant to legislation.

It seems to me that the lifecycle funds are a no-brainer. However, I'm new to federal service (37 yrs old and recently moved over from government contracting.) What reason(s) would there be for not making the move to lifecycle funds? Thank you!

Gary Amelio: Lifecycle funds are a great concept for every TSP participant. In fact, the only participants for whom lifecycle funds may not be appropriate would be those who hold assets outside of the TSP and who have engaged a professional investment consultant to manage their personal investment portfolio.

Washington, D.C.: How much does it cost to administer the TSP? I've heard it costs about 6 cents per account which is remarkably low. If that is accurate, why is it so low compared to other funds?

Gary Amelio: While I would like to focus on lifecycle funds, I am always pleased to talk about the TSP's 6 basis point expense ratio, which is the lowest fee of any legal investment in the world. Many private sector 401(k) plans pay between 50 and 150 basis points. Our low costs can be attributed to several factors including the use of index funds, the large size of plan assets over which to distribute the cost, competitive bidding of services, and self administration. To put this in perspective, 6 basis points means that participants paid just 60 cents per $1,000 of account balance last year for participating in the TSP.

Arlington, Va.: What did TSP officials see as the need or reason(s) for offering lifecycle funds ?

Gary Amelio: Industry surveys have shown that 90% of 401(k) plan participants either never reallocate their account balance or do so less frequently than once a year. The high percentage of TSP assets being held in the G fund gave creditability that this trend was also true in the TSP. Lifecycle funds offer ongoing professional asset allocation to participants at a low cost, and with no effort required by plan participants other than to continue to make contributions.

I'm 37 and due to the miracle of compound interest (and aggressive investing for the past 13 years) I have 111K in my TSP account. IF I pick a lifestyle fund, am I stuck with it? I really have no idea when or even IF I will ever be able to retire (no, I don't think I will be able to afford anything beyond a McD lunch once a month with Social Security), so I don't want to pick a day too soon and not get the overall great growth I've enjoyed for quite some time. Thanks.

Gary Amelio: Experts recommend that a participant select the one lifecycle fund that best fits his/her personal circumstances, and invest 100% of current assets and future contributions into that fund and stay with it. HOWEVER, the TSP is not restricting participant investment in lifecycle funds. This means that you can invest in any or all lifecycle funds as well as any or all of the existing five TSP funds and may change your investment direction at any time.

Washington, D.C.: Is there an exact date that these funds will be available for investment?

Gary Amelio: The lifecycle funds will be available for investment in the next several weeks. Keep watching the web site and your mailbox for the postcard and DVD.

Arlington, Va.: I'm interested in the factors used to make automatic choices for investors. Is age of employee the only factor? Or do lifecycle changes occur due to economic conditions and financial market influences?

Gary Amelio: Lifecycle funds are based solely upon time horizon, meaning a participant's plan to begin withdrawing assets. Time horizon may but is not in every circumstance based entirely upon a participant's age.

High percentage in G Fund: Could it be that those people who are in the G fund (which you use as evidence of the need for the lifecycle fund) will still not change their allocation simply because they really aren't thinking about changing it?

Gary Amelio: The substantial start up effort with the respect to the rollout of lifecycle funds is the investment education efforts the TSP is providing to participants. This education focuses on the importance of asset allocation and the need to invest on the efficient frontier over a longer time horizon to obtain optimum results. Some participants will elect the ease of automatic asset allocation offered by the lifecycle funds, some others will allocate on their own, and some no doubt will not feel comfortable with anything other than the G fund. In all of these cases, however, the participants will still benefit by receiving asset allocation education materials so that they can make an informed decision.

Rockville, Md.: Will the new funds be available to retirees? What are pros and cons of moving assets from G fund to the most conservative lifestyle fund?

Gary Amelio: Lifecycle funds are available for retiree participants and retirees are encouraged to utilize the L income or L 2010 fund. There is no additional cost for a retiree to do this and the retiree will benefit from the asset allocation mix into the equity markets offered by the lifecycle funds, but not within the G fund.

Arlington, Va.: I'm going to be 40 next year, and have about 9 years with the feds. I've been putting in the maximum amount, with the vast majority (80-90%) in C, with the rest in G and F. What would be a reason to change to a lifecycle fund?

Gary Amelio: The primary reason is the lifecycle fund is a professionally designed asset allocator, and continually rebalances and reallocates your account assets based on your time horizon with no effort required on your part.

Solomons, Md.: My partner and I are seventeen years apart in age. She is the one saving funds in a TSP. How would lifecycle funds accommodate generational gaps between couples?

Gary Amelio: The lifecycle fund is established based upon an individual participant's time horizon. The time horizon is not based upon age, but withdrawal date.

Washington, D.C.: Will the allocation of each lifecycle fund be announced before the availability date?

Gary Amelio: YES. They will be described in detail in the TSP Highlights and on the L Fund information sheet which will be published on www.tsp.gov, in the next couple of weeks.

Q&As about the lifecycle funds are currently on the web site, click on special interests from the home page.

Springfield, Va.: I am retiring in three months and may begin withdrawing my TSP money in regular monthly amounts. Would you recommend a lifestyle fund over simply transferring all my money into the G Fund and withdrawing it from there?

Gary Amelio: While we cannot ""recommend"" an investment, you should look at the L Income fund.

Arlington, Va.: I just had a look at www.tsp.gov, and it was not obvious at all that these plans are available.

Gary Amelio: Steve has just advised me that we are out of time. I am appreciative of having this opportunity to address the rollout of the lifecycle funds with all of you. Thank you for your questions which were very insightful. I encourage you all to keep an eye out in the coming several weeks for additional information on our web site www.tsp.gov as well as your mailbox for the postcard and the L fund DVD.

It’s heart breaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life! We have to do better & do what’s right. I’ve called my attorneys yesterday to see what can be done to fix this. # FreeCyntoiaBrownpic.twitter.com/73y26mLp7u ||||| Celebrities have come in force to support sex trafficking victim Cyntoia Brown. In 2004, Brown was sentenced to life in prison when she was 16 years old for killing the man who paid her for sex. 
  
 A photo that carried a caption loosely detailing Brown’s controversial trial surfaced online on Monday and went viral. It was shared by stars like Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, T.I and several others. 
  
 The image originated from filmmaker Daniel Birman’s 2011 documentary following the Tennessee-native’s case. The film gave insight on the physical, sexual and verbal abuse Brown suffered as a child before she was solicited for sex by 43-year-old realtor Johnny Mitchell Allen. Brown shot and killed Allen after being taken to his home. 
  
 Speaking with Tennessee’s Fox17 Nashville on Thursday, Birman explained Brown came from a family with a long history of sexual and physical abuse toward women. 
  
 “We started the conversation [with Brown being] a young girl who’s at the tail end of three generations of violence against women,” he said. “She had no chance.” 
  
 During Brown’s trial in 2004, she testified that being beaten, choked, dragged and raped was a regular occurrence in her household. She was often threatened at gunpoint. Her legal team argued the trauma of her childhood is essentially what led her shoot Allen after engaging in intercourse with him, which he paid for. 
  
 Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now 
  
 Even though Brown was legally a child when Allen paid her for sex, she was given a life sentence on murder and prostitution charges. She is eligible for parole after serving 51 years behind bars. 
  
 Birman’s documentary helped change sex trafficking and prostitution laws in Tennessee. Now only adults 18 years and older can be charged for prostitution. Children are deemed victims of sex trafficking in the state. But the new law didn't pertain to Brown. 
  
 Brown, now 29, has already spent nearly 13 years in prison. She completed her associate's degree behind bars and is reportedly working on her bachelors. She also serves as an unpaid consultant at the Juvenile Justice system. 
  
 A number of Tennessee residents rallied for Brown’s freedom, launching a clemency petition. So far, it has received more than 100,000 signatures. 
  
 Celebrities in the hip-hop community took to Instagram and Twitter to advocate against the unfair sentencing of people of color. In early November, a number of music industry elites launched a rally to fight the “unfair and unjust” sentencing of rapper Meek Mill, who was ordered to serve a 2 to 4-year prison sentence for violating his parole. ||||| In 2004, Cyntoia Brown was arrested for murder. There was no question that a 43-year-old man is dead and that she killed him. What mystified filmmaker Daniel Birman was just how common violence among youth is, and just how rarely we stop to question our assumptions about it. He wondered in this case what led a girl — who grew up in a reasonable home environment — to this tragic end? MORE 
  
 Me Facing Life: Cyntoia’s Story explores Cyntoia’s history and her future. Without attempting to excuse her crime as youthful indiscretion nor to vilify her as an example of a generation gone off the rails, Birman simply follows Cyntoia through six years of her life after the crime, and searches for answers to persistent questions. 
  
 The camera first glimpses Cyntoia the week of her arrest at age 16 and follows her for nearly six years. Along the way, nationally renowned juvenile forensic psychiatrist, Dr. William Bernet from Vanderbilt University, assesses her situation. We meet Ellenette Brown, Cyntoia’s adoptive mother who talks about the young girl’s early years. Georgina Mitchell, Cyntoia’s biological mother, meets her for the first time since she gave her up for adoption 14 years earlier. When we meet Cyntoia’s maternal grandmother, Joan Warren, some patterns begin to come into sharp focus. 
  
 Cyntoia wrestles with her fate. She is stunningly articulate, and spends the time to put the pieces of this puzzle together with us. Cyntoia's pre-prison lifestyle was nearly indistinguishable from her mother's at the same age.

"Starbucks' online store is discounting items up to 50% as the coffee giant prepares to shutter the store for good. 
  
 The company will close its online store on October 1, a Starbucks representative confirmed to Business Insider. 
  
 Starbucks' online store sells items such as glasses, mugs, coffee brewers, and espresso makers, in addition to coffee, tea, and beverage syrups. People will still be able to buy items currently sold online at third-party sellers like Amazon and Starbucks' grocery partners. 
  
 ""We're continuing to invest in amplifying Starbucks as a must-visit destination and are looking across our portfolio to make disciplined, thoughtful decisions,"" Starbucks spokesperson Maggie Jantzen said. 
  
 She added: ""Continued integration of these digital and mobile customer connections into our store experience is among the highest priorities for us, and to enhance that focus we've looked for ways to simplify our current efforts."" 
  
 Jantzen said that Starbucks will keep frequent visitors of the online store up to date on product availability, especially as certain items sell out. 
  
 As Starbucks shutters its online store, the coffee giant is looking to build ""commercial partnerships"" with digital companies. 
  
 ""These partnerships, we believe, will enable us to leverage our brand, our global retail footprint, and the customer base in order to extend our reach,"" CEO Kevin Johnson said in a call with investors in late July. 
  
 Starbucks is also growing its consumer packaged goods (CPG) business, selling items such as K-cup pods and bottled Frappuccinos in grocery stores. Earlier in August, Starbucks announced that it would begin selling its new bottled Pumpkin Spice Latte in grocery stores later in the month. 
  
 Starbucks has made serious investments in digital over the last few years, as executives have witnessed retailers struggle to cope with the rise of ecommerce. Currently, mobile payments make up 30% of Starbucks orders in the US. 
  
 ""Retailers who are agile and reimagine the art of the possible will be big industry winners,"" Johnson told investors on the industry's ""seismic shift"" towards digital and mobile. ""Those who do not will struggle mightily.""

 Get the Slide Deck Now » The Future of Retail 2018 by the BI Intelligence Research Team. ||||| In an unusual legal move, Simon Property Group Inc. has sued Starbucks Corp. over the coffee giant’s plan to close 78 Teavana stores in its malls across the country. 
  
 Indianapolis-based Simon, the country’s largest shopping mall operator, says in the lawsuit that Starbucks is breaching its leases by closing the Teavana stores and “shirking its contractual obligations at the expense of Simon’s shopping centers and the dozens of communities they serve and support.” 
  
 In the suit, filed Aug. 21 in Marion Superior Court, Simon said it is seeking temporary and permanent injunctions preventing Starbucks from closing the stores. 
  
 Seattle-based Starbucks announced July 27 that it planned to close all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with most closures taking place in the spring of 2018. 
  
 Simon, though, said Starbucks recently indicated that it intends to close the stores no later than Dec. 31. The mall landlord said only two of its Teavana leases expire prior to the spring and the other 76 extend as far as January 2027. 
  
 “In order to successfully operate its shopping centers, Simon depends upon each tenant fulfilling the covenants in their respective leases,” the company said in its suit. “Crucially, each of Simon’s tenants promises that it will open and operate continuously for the entire term of its lease.” 
  
 In the Indianapolis area, Teavana operates at Circle Centre mall, the Fashion Mall at Keystone, Castleton Square Mall and Greenwood Park Mall. 
  
 In January 2013, Starbucks—then led by Howard Schultz—bought the Atlanta-based tea retailer for $620 million. At the time, Teavana had about 300 stores. Schultz predicted the business would swell in size and that his company ""would do for tea what we did for coffee."" 
  
 In April, the same month Kevin Johnson took the helm as CEO, Starbucks said it was disappointed in the performance of the Teavana stores and was reviewing its options. Three months later, Johnson cited declining foot traffic in malls as a reason for closing the stores. With “that headwind and with all of the work we have done to reinvent the store, it just couldn’t overcome that,"" Johnson said. 
  
 That comment didn't sit well with Simon, which said in the lawsuit that it was intended ""to deflect blame from itself and avoid adverse investor reaction."" Simon noted that just a year ago Starbucks had boasted that its tea business was growing rapidly. 
  
 In the lawsuit, Simon said it has seen a long line of retailers close mall stores in recent years because of “financial distress,” including Sears, Sports Authority, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Finish Line, Macy’s, Nine West, Rue 21, Jones New York, American Eagle and others. 
  
 “Those retailers, at least, claimed closure was necessary to avoid bankruptcy, and that staying open and fulfilling their leases would cause them financial ruin,” Simon said in the suit. “That obviously is not the case with Starbucks, which is one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” 
  
 Teavana isn’t losing money, Simon said in the suit—it just isn’t growing fast enough to fit into Starbucks’ business strategy. 
  
 Starbucks is a “thriving company” with a market capitalization of more than $80 billion that is coming off a record quarter in which it opened 575 net new stores, Simon said. 
  
 “Starbucks’ decision to close its Teavana stores is simply an effort to further increase its economic gains at the expense of others,” Simon said. “Starbucks does not contend that Simon breached any lease or that Starbucks cannot remain viable if it continues to honor its promises in its leases for stores in Simon’s shopping centers. Instead, Starbucks simply believes it can make more money if it violates the leases than if it honored its contractual promises and obligations.” 
  
 Simon said in the suit that its leasing teams typically begin working with tenants more than a year before leases expire to arrange new leases or to begin looking for replacement tenants. Mass store closings mid-lease disrupt that orderly process, Simon said, hurting the malls themselves and other retail tenants. 
  
  
  
 “Simon can plan for and address scheduled store closures, but only if tenants fulfill their covenants and operate continuously during the term of their leases,” the suit says. “Tenants that do not live up to their continuous operation obligations cause great upheaval for both Simon and their fellow tenants.” 
  
 The suit, filed by Indianapolis-based law firm Barnes & Thornburg LLP, did not specify how much Simon was seeking in financial relief or damages. 
  
 Starbucks officials were not available Sunday night to comment on the suit. 
  
 Simon said Teavana stores are “a valuable contribution to the synergistic mix of tenants” in Simon malls. 
  
 “A shopping center is not merely a random collection of stores,” Simon said. “Rather, it is a co-dependent ecosystem of tenants with a complex system of governance that ensures its wellbeing. Tenants depend on a mix of a certain types of retailers. ... Accordingly, Simon enters into long-term leases with its tenants to provide stability in Simon’s occupancy rate and tenant mix.” ||||| Indianapolis-based shopping mall developer Simon Property Group is suing Starbucks over the coffee chain’s plans to close Teavana stores in malls nationwide. 
  
 The lawsuit argues Starbucks doesn’t have grounds to break its leases on 78 Teavana stores at Simon-owned malls, including five stores in Indiana. 
  
 Four years after buying the mostly mall-based tea brand, Starbucks said in July it would close down its 379 Teavana stores. 
  
 Most of the stores in Simon malls have years left on their leases, according to the lawsuit filed Aug. 21 in Marion County Superior Court. 
  
 “A shopping center is not merely a random collection of stores,” lawyers for Simon write in their complaint. “Rather, it is a co-dependent ecosystem of tenants with a complex system of governance that ensures its wellbeing.” 
  
 That’s why, the suit argues, Starbucks shouldn’t be able to leave its lease agreements early. 
  
 Unlike other retailers that have pulled out of Simon malls in recent years, the suit says, Starbucks hasn’t claimed it needs to cut its Teavana leases short in order to avoid bankruptcy. 
  
 “Rather, the decision is solely an effort to enrich Starbucks’ profits by shirking its contractual obligations at the expense of Simon’s Shopping Centers and the dozens of communities they serve and support,” the suit says. 
  
 The suit asks the court to prevent the stores from closing prematurely. 
  
 A Simon spokesman wouldn’t comment on any other damages they might seek. 
  
 A Starbucks spokesperson says in an email, “We are responding to the lawsuit and are working to resolve this dispute.”

"News article: McDonough says attack on Assad regime would send message to Iran

By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC News

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday that an impending U.S. attack on Syria would send a message to Iranian leaders that they should not feel free to develop nuclear weapons.

McDonough said on NBC’s Meet the Press that “to communicate with them we have to be very clear, very forthright. This is an opportunity to be both with the Iranians....”

He said, “nobody is rebutting the intelligence; nobody doubts the intelligence” that is the basis for President Barack Obama pinning the blame for an August 21 chemical weapons attack in Syria on President Bashar Assad's regime which is fighting to suppress a rebellion that began in 2011.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough visits Meet the Press to discuss recently released footage of a chemical assault on the Syrian people.

McDonough noted that “our troops have not been subject to chemical weapons attacks since World War I” and argued that “we have to make sure that for the sake of our guys – our men and women on the front lines – that we reinforce this prohibition against using chemical weapons.”

If Assad is not deterred, he will put chemical weapons on the front lines in his battle against the Syrian rebels and that would mean “a greater risk of them being proliferated” and perhaps falling into terrorists’ hands, McDonough argued.

He added that “the momentum on the battle field will be changed by a targeted, limited effort” but he said ultimately “there’s not a military resolution” to the civil war in Syria, only a “political, diplomatic resolution.”

McDonough’s appearance on Meet the Press and other Sunday talk shows was one part of an intense public offensive headed by Obama himself, including the president doing interviews Monday with six television networks and culminating in his speech to the nation Tuesday night.

McDonough said Obama wants Congress to be “a full partner” in military action against Assad’s regime.

Obama faces one of the crucial weeks of his presidency with the Senate headed for a vote as early as Wednesday to end debate on a measure authorizing an attack on Syria; the measure’s supporters need 60 votes to move it ahead to final passage.

Reaction from members of Congress has ranged from endorsing an attack to wariness to fervent opposition.

The division on the issue hasn’t followed party lines.

Sen. Tom Udall, D- N.M., who voted against the resolution authorizing use of military force last week in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Meet the Press Sunday that he was “very disappointed that the administration has given up” on the United Nations and “on rallying the world.”

The American people, Udall said, “don’t want to be embroiled in a Middle Eastern civil war; this is an act of war that we’re going to take. We haven’t exhausted all of our political, economic, and diplomatic alternatives.” Obama, he charged, “is moving much too rapidly down the war path and not trying to find a political solution….”

Another Democrat, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D- Calif. said she was leaning against the resolution authorizing use of force. She said it is not clear to her that United States national security is directly at risk from Assad’s regime. “I haven’t heard that Assad wants to use the weapons against us; I haven’t heard that he wants to use the weapons against our allies (or ) that he’s moving them to terrorist organizations.”

She said, “The minute that one of those cruise missiles lands in there, we are in the Syrian war. It’s a civil war and we’re taking sides with the rebels,” some of whom, she said, were linked to al Qaeda.

Sanchez indicated that she’s quite skeptical of Obama’s argument that any military action will be carefully limited: “For the president to say, ‘this is just, you know, a very quick thing and we’re out of there.’ That’s how long wars start.”

Republican Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who he said he couldn’t support Obama’s plan, agreed with Sanchez: “Once we hit, this is an act of war. Little wars start big wars.” He called an attack on Assad “kind of a face-saving measure” by Obama “after he drew the red line” against use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime.

Even Rep. Peter King, R- N.Y., who supports an attack on the Assad regime and warned Sunday of the danger of an “Iran-Syrian axis in the Middle East,” harshly criticized Obama whom he said has been “vacillating. I can’t imagine Harry Truman or John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan or Dwight Eisenhower ever putting the nation in a position like this….”

He said, “I wish he was more of a commander-in-chief than a community organizer.”

In another example of the Syria issue crossing party lines, Sen. Mark Pryor, D- Ark, who is up for re-election next year, announced Saturday that he opposes an attack, while his Republican opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, has said he strongly supports military action and wants to go even further and topple the Assad regime to achieve “an ultimate victory in Syria” with “a pro-Western, moderate native Syrian government” taking Assad’s place.

Pryor said Saturday that the Obama administration had to “prove a compelling national security interest, clearly define a mission that has a definitive end-state, and then build a true coalition of allies” that would take part in action against Assad. But “based on the information presented to me and the evidence I have gathered, I do not believe these criteria have been met, and I cannot support military action against Syria at this time,” Pryor said.

Obama said Friday, “it’s conceivable that at the end of the day I don’t persuade a majority of the American people that it's the right thing to do,” but he added that sometimes members of Congress must do what they think is right even if they go against their constituents’ wishes.

Obama has not explicitly said whether he might choose to launch an attack anyway even if Congress votes down a resolution authorizing him to attack Syria. He rebuffed reporters’ questions on that point in a press conference Friday at the meeting of G-20 nations in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar Assad has emerged in the U.S. media, granting an interview to CBS' Charlie Rose, which will be aired Monday. While the network did not release direct quotes from the exchange, Rose said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that Assad denied having anything to do with the chemical weapons attack that has the world on edge.

""He does accept some of the responsibility"" for the attack that killed almost 1,500 Syrian civilians - including hundreds of children, Rose said. ""I asked that very question: 'Do you feel any remorse?' He said, 'Of course I do,' but it did not come in a way that was sort of deeply felt inside. It was much more of a calm recitation of anybody who's a leader of a country would feel terrible about what's happened to its citizens.""

"Rex Ryan: Foot-Fetish Report 'Personal Matter'
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. – New York Jets coach Rex Ryan says it's a ""personal matter"" and declined to talk about a ""foot-fetish"" report posted by the sports website Deadspin that show four videos of a woman who bears a close resemblance to Ryan's wife, Michelle.

The videos show a woman displaying her toes to an off-screen cameraman who, in one video, sounds a lot like the coach. The two are having an intimate chat about her feet.

During his news conference Wednesday, Ryan declined several times to discuss the situation.

""I understand I'm going to get asked this question frontways, sideways, backways, and all this, but it is a personal matter,"" he said.

Asked if the NFL might look into the report, spokesman Greg Aiello said the league also considered it a personal matter.

Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said in a brief statement that he and owner Woody Johnson met with Ryan and the coach has their ""full support.""

Like everyone else, they considered it a personal matter.

This isn't the first time the Jets have turned up on Deadspin this season.

In October, the site reported that Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre sent racy text messages and photos to a former game hostess while he was the Jets' quarterback in 2008.

The NFL is still investigating the allegations.

According to Deadspin, the woman in the video goes by the handle ""ihaveprettyfeet.""

A still photograph from one of the video clips was splashed across the front of the New York Daily News and showed a woman with her feet hanging out of an SUV. She is approached by someone who is not on camera and he tells her that she has ""really beautiful feet.""

The other videos show the woman sitting on a couch, having a drink, reading a book and sitting on a porch and rubbing her feet.

""My wife's beautiful,"" Ryan said when asked about his wife. ""We've been married for 23 years. She's awesome.""

A few weeks ago, before the Jets played New England, Ryan compared his wife to Giselle Bundchen, who is married to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Ryan said he was ""also married to a supermodel.""

""I don't want to say that I probably shouldn't have done that,"" Ryan said.

While the Jets have a big game coming up against the Bears in which they can clinch a postseason berth if the win, the focus again is on the team's off-field issues.

""We're going to be ready to play Chicago,"" Ryan said. ""I am ready. This is my job and I'm focused on the job at hand.""

Most players declined comment on the foot-fetish report, but star cornerback Darrelle Revis supported his coach.

""Foot fetish? Whatever,"" Revis said. ""I mean, that's his wife. At the end of the day, that's his wife and he can do whatever he wants with his wife. It's not like he's out committing adultery or anything negative.""

Last week, the team suspended an assistant coach indefinitely for tripping a Miami player and ordering inactive players to form a sideline wall.

Sal Alosi, the Jets' strength and conditioning coach, was suspended without pay for the rest of the season, including the playoffs, and fined an additional $25,000.

The Jets were investigated by the league in September after a female reporter, Ines Sainz of TV Azteca, said she felt uncomfortable in the team's locker room. The Jets developed a workplace conduct program, underwritten by owner Woody Johnson.

In January, Ryan was fined $50,000 by the team after he was caught on a cell phone camera flipping his middle finger at a fan during a mixed martial arts competition in Sunrise, Fla. The image of Ryan quickly spread across the Internet and made its way onto the back pages of New York tabloids. He apologized the next day in a statement, calling his actions ""stupid and inappropriate.""

"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to connect the brain with computers. Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. ""Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord  to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries  or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part."" Tavella says. ""Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines."" The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp  and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands."" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair."" He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from. And the other is sure that they can use the technology for long.

"Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk.  Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home to save money on energy and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health.

"Answer the following question: Information:  - An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term ""accident"" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015).  - Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.   - Nazareth (""Narat"" ""Narath"" ""an-Nira"") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as ""the Arab capital of Israel"". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. ""Upper Nazareth"") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - Lazarus of Bethany , also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days , is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John , in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death . The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life . In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John , the Raising of Lazarus is the climactic narrative : exemplifying the power of Jesus `` over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity -- death . For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel . '' A figure named `` Lazarus '' ( Latinised from the Aramaic :  , Elzr , cf. Heb. Eleazar -- `` God is my help '' ) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . The two Biblical characters named `` Lazarus '' have sometimes been conflated historically , but are generally understood to be two separate people . The name `` Lazarus '' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life ; for example , the scientific term `` Lazarus taxon '' denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction . There are also numerous literary uses of the term .  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as ""rabbi"". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: ""Pontius Pltus"", , ""Pontios Pltos"") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking. Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery. Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and...  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...

The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up.  The bonding   between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish   scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding.  To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding.  Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter.  Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.

After the release of better-than-expected deficit data for 2014, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said there were reasons to be confident about growth.
Official data showed the 2014 deficit was 4% instead of the 4.4% forecast, and will fall to about 3.8% this year, Mr Sapin predicted.
The eurozone's second biggest economy has held back the euro bloc's growth.
Following the improved data, Mr Sapin said economic growth could beat the government's 1% forecast. ""A lower-than-expected deficit brings confidence,"" he said. ""We will do better than 1% (economic) growth in 2015.""
Public spending has fallen, and last year's expected shortfall in revenues was not a bad as initially thought. ""Things are falling into place to back the scenario of growth accelerating in 2015,"" said Credit Agricole economist Axelle Lacan.
The eurozone's second-largest economy grew by 0.4% in 2014, the data confirmed on Thursday, the same pace as in 2013.
France, which has repeatedly missed its fiscal targets, is confident it will finally bring the deficit below an EU cap of 3% of GDP in 2017.
President Francois Hollande, during his 2012 election campaign, had pledged to bring the deficit down to the EU limit by end-2013 but his government has since pushed the target back several times.
This month, European Union finance ministers gave France two more years to cut the deficit to the 3% limit, extending the deadline for the third time since 2009.
Recent economic data has showed that although unemployment is still rising, business confidence has improved.

"Generate a question that has the following answer:  Dathan  for the following movie plot:  Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.

To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life. Born in Manhattan on October 25, 1872, Henry is the spoiled only child of stuffy, clueless, wealthy parents Randolph (Louis Calhern) and Bertha (Spring Byington). His paternal grandmother (Clara Blandick in an uncredited role) is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve (Charles Coburn), a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up an idle young man, with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone. Intrigued, he follows her into a Brentano's and pretends to be an employee to get to know her better. Despite learning that she is engaged, he begins making advances, finally confessing he does not work there, whereupon she hastily departs. Later, obnoxious cousin Albert (Allyn Joslyn) introduces the family to his fiancÃ©e, Martha (Gene Tierney), and her feuding parents, the Strables (Eugene Pallette, Marjorie Main). Henry is shocked to find that his mystery woman and Martha are one and the same. It turns out that Albert was the first suitor of whom both her parents approved. Fearful of spending the rest of her life as a spinster in Kansas City, Martha agreed to marry him. Henry convinces her to elope with him instead. Though everyone (except Grandpa Van Cleve) is scandalized, eventually they are received back into the family. Henry and Martha enjoy a happy marriage and become the proud parents of a boy. On the eve of their tenth anniversary, however, Martha finds out about Henry's continuing dalliances with other women and goes back to her parents. Henry and Grandpa follow her there.

"Summarize this article:

The Stoke City boss came within one game of reaching the 1986 and 1994 World Cups and as manager almost took Wales to Euro 2004.
While acknowledging the contribution of stars like Gareth Bale, Ashley Williams and Aaron Ramsey, Hughes has been impressed by the team that carried Wales to Euro 2016 - a feat that, on Monday, is expected to bring manager Chris Coleman a two-year contract extension.
""Right from the start you could sense that there was something special happening and they got the job done at the key moments,"" Hughes told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
""That was something my teams and the teams I was involved in [as a player] weren't able to do.""
Hughes added: ""With this group of players, they've been together a long time and you sense there could be at least one more tournament out of them after the European Championship.
""Gareth has the ability to change games and he's done that on numerous occasions for Wales by being the difference in key games when you need your players to produce.""
Hughes scored in the final 1986 World Cup qualifier against Scotland in a highly-charged game which the Scots drew 1-1, ending Wales' hopes of qualification.
Scotland boss Jock Stein collapsed just before full time in the game and subsequently died of a heart attack, something which Hughes reflects on.
""We knew that it was a serious situation that developed. The football itself and the game went into insignificance as it would do,"" he added.
""We were disappointed because of the result but in the wider scheme of things there are more important things on the night.""
Wales' 58-year wait to reach an international tournament made it a difficult task for Hughes to deal with in his time as a player and manager.
""We had to accept that the longer it went on, the more difficult it became. Because we're a lower-seeded nation, invariably we were the fourth seed out of five,"" he said.
""That meant that you always had to overcome about three outstanding teams that on paper were better resourced and had better talent available to them.""
Hughes was appointed as Wales manager in 1999 as replacement for Bobby Gould, when he was still representing his country as a player, but needed the support of some of the older members of the squad at first.
""I had a lot of good will when I got the job because the lads had gone through a period where it was hard work to play for Wales,"" he added.
""I had no experience in terms of managing a group and I needed a little bit of time and the support of the senior guys.""
The defeat by Russia in the second leg of the Euro 2004 qualifying play-offs affected Hughes, and he feels his inexperience was a contributory factor.
""I never watched that game back. It was just one of those games where looking back, you think would I have done that and should I have done this?
""At that stage I was still an inexperienced manager. I would love to have the same opportunity, in the same circumstances.
""I've managed for 300, 400 odd games and I think I'd make a better fist of it now.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Towards the end of his reign as Wales manager, Hughes received criticism from former boss John Toshack, who was appointed as his replacement after he was sacked in 2004.
Toshack had previously managed Wales in one game in 1994.
""Truth be known, the criticism did annoy me,"" admits Hughes.
""Looking back I think some of it was justified at the time. There were moments when we could have done things better but things sometimes go against you.
""Tosh felt it was a role that he might like. Possibly the fact we had 70,000 watching every game made it a bit more attractive than the first time he was manager.
""A lot of the senior guys came to the end of their international careers. Whether that was accelerated because of John's appointment you'd have to ask the individuals. Some would have said it probably did.""

"Background: Baudelaire was born in Paris, France, on April 9, 1821, and baptized two months later at Saint-Sulpice Roman Catholic Church. His father, Francois Baudelaire, a senior civil servant and amateur artist, was 34 years older than Baudelaire's mother, Caroline. Francois died during Baudelaire's childhood, in 1827. The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts.
Context: Baudelaire next worked on a translation and adaptation of Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater. Other works in the years that followed included Petits Poemes en prose (Small Prose poems); a series of art reviews published in the Pays, Exposition universelle (Country, World Fair); studies on Gustave Flaubert (in L'Artiste, October 18, 1857); on Theophile Gautier (Revue contemporaine, September 1858); various articles contributed to Eugene Crepet's Poetes francais; Les Paradis artificiels: opium et haschisch (French poets; Artificial Paradises: opium and hashish) (1860); and Un Dernier Chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de Balzac (A Final Chapter of the history of works of Balzac) (1880), originally an article ""Comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du genie"" (""How one pays one's debts when one has genius""), in which his criticism turns against his friends Honore de Balzac, Theophile Gautier, and Gerard de Nerval.  By 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of laudanum, his life of stress, and his poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at Honfleur. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem Le Voyage being one example of his efforts during that time. In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of Richard Wagner.  His financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the rights to his works and also to give lectures. His long-standing relationship with Jeanne Duval continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan Apollonie Sabatier, though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked opium, and in Brussels he began to drink to excess. Baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and paralysis followed. After more than a year of aphasia, he received the last rites of the Catholic Church. The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in ""maisons de sante"" in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the Cimetiere du Montparnasse, Paris.  Many of Baudelaire's works were published posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and at last she found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. ""I see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature."" She lived another four years.

"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What language was replaced in Central Asia? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.

"It is feared Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, plan to join Islamic State.
Shamima's sister Renu urged her not to ""do anything stupid"", adding she is ""our baby"". Halima Khanom, Kadiza's sister, said: ""Everyone is hurting.""
Amira's father Abase Hussen said: ""We cannot stop crying. Don't go to Syria.""
Kadiza, Shamima and Amira flew from Gatwick to Turkey on Tuesday after telling their parents they were going out for the day - but it is not clear whether they have crossed into Syria.
In a tearful video, Ms Begum, 27, said there was no indication her younger sister had been thinking of leaving for Syria and said her disappearance had left ""a big hole"" in the family house.
She said Shamima had been ""upset"" after a friend from her school left for Syria and said the family was hoping the girls had ""gone to go and bring her back"".
Shamima was last seen on Tuesday morning when she was dropped off at a bus stop, claiming she had extra classes at school.
""There was no indication whatsoever. She was just herself. There was nothing different about her. There were no changes in her behaviour in anything. She was just our baby, she was just herself,"" Ms Begum said.
""We don't want her to do anything stupid - she is a sensible girl,"" she said, adding: ""We just want her home, we want her safe.""
Ms Begun said the three girls were ""young"" and ""vulnerable"" and if anybody had tried to persuade them to go to Syria it was a ""cruel and evil"" thing to do.
""They're preying on young innocent girls and it's not right,"" she added.
Mr Hussen said his daughter, Amira, had told him she was going to a wedding on Tuesday and sent a text between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT.
""She said, 'Dad the place is a little bit far. I pray my midday prayer and I get back.' She didn't come home,"" he said.
The family reported Amira as missing that night.
""We are depressed, and it's very stressful,"" he said while holding a teddy Amira had given her mother for Mother's Day.
""The message we have for Amira is to get back home. We miss you. We cannot stop crying. Please think twice. Don't go to Syria.""
He said his daughter had never spoken about an interest in the militant group with him.
""She doesn't dare discuss something like this with us. She knows what the answer would be,"" he said.
In a further direct appeal to his daughter, he said: ""Remember how we love you. Your sister and brother cannot stop crying.""
Halima Khanom, the eldest sister of Kadiza, said her family was ""hurting"" and urged her to contact them.
In a direct appeal, she said: ""Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you are safe and you are okay. That is all we ask of you.""
Police say the girls boarded a Turkish Airlines flight, which departed from Gatwick Airport at 12:40 GMT for Istanbul.
Officers said the girls had previously been interviewed after another girl from their school - Bethnal Green Academy, in east London - went to Syria in December, but nothing had indicated they were at risk.
Meanwhile, the family of a Glasgow woman who may have encouraged the three girls to join IS said officials had ""failed"" to stop them leaving the UK.
Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who went to Syria to be a ""jihadi bride"" in 2013, uses a Twitter account to encourage British women to join her. Last Sunday, Shamima sent her a message via Twitter.
In a statement, Ms Mahmood's family said she was a ""disgrace"" to the family and they were ""full of horror and anger"" that she may have had ""a role to play"" in recruiting the girls.
""However, the security services have serious questions to answer,"" the family added.
Scotland Yard said it would not discuss matters of surveillance and security.

"Read this article and answer this question Coming off their Monday Night road win over the Broncos, the Packers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Kansas City Chiefs (the only team that QB Brett Favre had never beaten). After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay drew first blood with rookie kicker Mason Crosby getting a 48-yard and a 36-yard field goal. However, the Chiefs would take the lead into halftime as RB Larry Johnson completed a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Packers regained the lead as Favre completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Kansas City regained the lead with QB Damon Huard completing a 30-yard TD pass to Johnson. Green Bay replied with Crosby kicking a 32-yard field goal, yet the Chiefs answered with Huard completing a 17-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez (with RB Priest Holmes getting the 2-point conversion run). The Packers pulled back into the lead as Favre and Jennings hooked up again on a 60-yard TD pass. Afterwards, Crosby made a 45-yard field goal, and CB Charles Woodson returned an interception 46&#160;yards for a touchdown. With the win, the Packers improved to 7-1.  Brett Favre also became the third quarterback to defeat all of the other 31 NFL teams at least once.  Peyton Manning and Tom Brady had been the first two to do so, just hours apart, the week before.

 A long-awaited State Department review of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline failed to reach firm conclusions on the project's environmental impact, but it lent support to backers of the contentious plan on several key points. 
  
 Industry groups cheered the draft review, saying the hundreds of pages of technical assessments didn't turn up major issues with the plan to ship oil from Canadian tar sands through the northern Great Plains. 
  
 The assessment found that under a revised route offered last year by pipeline builder TransCanada Corp., ""there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed project route."" 
  
 The ... ||||| The State Department's draft review of the Keystone XL pipeline offers little guidance as to whether President Obama will support or reject it this year.

 The State Department riled environmentalists with a largely positive review Friday of a controversial Canada-to-U.S. pipeline, saying the project would not significantly alter the development of Canada's tar sands. 
  
 In its long-awaited draft environmental review of the Keystone XL, the State Department said the pipeline won't make much of a difference to climate change because the tar sands will likely be developed anyway. ""Approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands, or on the amount of heavy crude oil refined in the Gulf Coast area,"" the nearly 2,000-page document says. 
  
 Yet Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones emphasized that the draft is a ""technical review"" and the State Department will issue its final report after a 45-day public comment period. 
  
 ""This report does not come out one way or another. ... It really has no recommendations,"" she told reporters. The pipeline needs the department's approval because it crosses the U.S. border. 
  
 President Obama, who has pledged repeatedly to tackle climate change, has said he'll make the final call on the billion-dollar project — expected as early as this summer. Many environmentalists, who have cast Keystone as a litmus test of his support, weren't pleased with the State Department's draft review. 
  
 ""Groundhog Day — we're hearing the same rehashed arguments from the State Department about why a great threat to the climate is not a threat at all,"" 350.org founder Bill McKibben said in a statement. ""Mother Nature filed her comments last year — the hottest year in American history."" 
  
 The project's developer, Calgary-based TransCanada welcomed the draft, saying it gets the company one step closer to building the pipeline. ""It makes sense for this oil to come from a stable, democratic neighbor such as Canada,"" company President Russ Girling said in a statement. 
  
 Some climate scientists say the production of Canada's tar sands, which the pipeline would carry through several U.S. states, emits more greenhouse gases than that of conventional crude oil. Environmentalists say potential spills or leaks could also damage water supplies. 
  
 ""To say that say the tar sands have little climate impact is an absurdity. The total carbon in tar sands exceeds that in all oil burned in human history,"" says James Hansen, who directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. 
  
 Supporters, including the oil industry and many GOP lawmakers such as House Speaker John Boehner, say it would reduce U.S. dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil. 
  
 The draft review says the project would deliver a temporary economic boost in terms of jobs and taxes, but it identifies 13 vulnerable species that could be hurt, such as the whooping crane and the greater sage-grouse. It says the project could hurt farmland soil and water supplies, but it says steps could be taken to minimize these potential problems. 
  
 ""The pipeline would be buried deep enough to avoid surface impacts of climate changes (freeze-thaw cycles, fires and temperature extremes),"" the report says, although it says the project could trigger increases in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. 
  
 In January 2012, Obama rejected the initial 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Port Arthur, Texas, saying he needed more time for environmental review. 
  
 TransCanada has since split the project into two parts and offered a revised route for the northern leg that avoids some environmentally sensitive areas in Nebraska. It received approval last year from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the 485-mile, $2.3 billion southern leg of the project from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast. 
  
 Obama's pending decision involves the 875 miles of the northern leg that would stretch from the Canadian border through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb.. If approved, construction is slated to begin in 2015. 
  
 The pressure on the White House intensified after Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, who like Obama had rejected the initial route, notified the president last month that he'd approved the revised route through his state. Heineman, a Republican, said it would avoid environmentally sensitive areas and bring jobs and other economic benefits. 
  
 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/XfE0Rw ||||| The State Department’s long-awaited environmental report on the Keystone XL pipeline leaves President Barack Obama with no real scientific reason to reject the nation’s most fiercely debated energy project. 
  
 The sprawling 2,000-page report, released late Friday afternoon, doesn’t issue a clear yea or nay on a sprawling section of pipeline that would traverse from western Canada to Oklahoma. But the report’s key takeaways — including a conclusion that the project would have “no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route” — Obama may have been hemmed in by his own State Department experts.

 Environmentalists were left sputtering Friday while pro-pipeline forces in Congress and industry insisted that this should leave no doubt that the pipeline can be built safely and provide for jobs and a fresh source of North American energy.

 “Today’s report again makes clear there is no reason for this critical pipeline to be blocked one more day,” House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. “After four years of needless delays, it is time for President Obama to stand up for middle-class jobs and energy security and approve the Keystone pipeline.” 
  
 The report also counters warnings from environmentalists that the pipeline’s construction would spur a huge increase in production from western Canada’s tar sands, believed to be one of the biggest reserves of crude oil outside Saudi Arabia — unleashing torrents of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
  
 Without addressing those emissions overtly, the State Department suggests the issue may be moot because Canada will tap into its lucrative oil sands “with or without the proposed project.” It adds that “approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands, or on the amount of heavy crude oil refined in the Gulf Coast area.” 
  
 (Also on POLITICO: Bipartisan coalition issues broad energy blueprint) 
  
 The report came about a year-and-a-half after the department issued a “final” report in August 2011 on Keystone that said the pipeline would cause minimal environmental impact. After massive White House sit-ins by anti-Keystone protesters followed, leading to arrests of more than 1,200 people, the department announced it would have to take a second look at the pipeline’s impact on sensitive water resources in Nebraska — kicking the issue past the 2012 election. 
  
 (PHOTOS: Forward on Climate rally) 
  
 The pipeline became a durable campaign issue anyway for Republicans and oil industry groups. Mitt Romney repeatedly promised that he would approve Keystone on “Day One” of his administration. 
  
 The Sierra Club, one of many environmental groups hoping for a clear thumbs-down, said it was “outraged” by Friday’s outcome . 
  
 “We’re mystified as to how the State Department can acknowledge the negative effects of the Earth’s dirtiest oil on our climate, but at the same time claim that the proposed pipeline will ‘not likely result in significant adverse environmental effects,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, one of dozens of activists who were arrested in an anti-Keystone protest last month after tying himself to the White House gate. “Whether this failure was willful or accidental, this report is nothing short of malpractice.” 
  
 Brune later told reporters, “You know the news is bad when it’s buried at 4 p.m. on a Friday afternoon.” He said the State Department’s report will make it tougher for the U.S. to be a global leader on climate change. 
  
 Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford warned that “letting corporations get rich off of environmental devastation will make Obama’s climate rhetoric look like the worst kind of greenwashing.” |||||

"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output ""No answer"".  Question: Where do the survivors run? Movie plot title: The Grey Movie plot: John Ottway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska, killing wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter ""without purpose"" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through. The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and luggage starts getting sucked out. Then the plane tips upside down and the roof gets ripped off. Ottway blacks out just before it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. One of the team, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), is mortally wounded. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the grey wolf feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators. Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site. While walking, Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching, and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry. Diaz threatens Ottway with a knife, but is disarmed and ultimately begins regretting his actions. An omega wolf sent by the alpha wolf to test them attacks, but they kill and roast it for food. Diaz beheads the corpse and throws the head back at the pack, a move noted by the group...

"Answer by taking a quote from the following article:

Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler.

From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.  From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become ""what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.""  His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by ""promoting"" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married ""Mischa"" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802.  Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (""The Prize""), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg.  At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ?  Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released.

"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments? is inside the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: ""Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.""Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as ""chicks"", and she resented being regarded as ""a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention"".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as ""the most prolific songwriter on the scene"" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, ""I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End."" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

"Article: Before you begin to study for an exam, you need to have taken good notes in class. Listen to what your teacher says closely. Many times, teachers will drop clues to what will be covered on the test. These hints can range from going over the information multiple times, using words like ""important"" or ""key"" when covering an idea, to even saying, ""This will be on the exam.""  Write down everything you think is important. The more you write down during class, the better prepared you will be for the test. Review your notes each day. Don't cram. Waiting until the night before an exam only hurts you. Cramming will sometimes give you a passing grade, but it is not an effective, reliable study method. Students who study consistently, but in shorter amounts of time, do better in school. To avoid cramming, read your notes daily so you learn the information as you go along. Even if the teacher gives you one, make your own outline for the information covered on the test. Include the main concepts and ideas that will be covered on the test. Include examples, definitions, formulas, and other pertinent information.  Make your own questions to test yourself. If you know there will be an essay on the test, then come up with essay questions and answers. Study with another student in the class and ask each other questions about the material. Make flashcards. Place definitions, concepts, themes, dates, and formulas on flashcards to quiz yourself. Reword concepts on your study guide. Many teachers ask information in different ways to see how well your synthesis of the material is. Think of other ways questions might be asked or another way a concept could be presented on the exam. You should never ignore the information until the date of the exam. You should review the information daily and weekly to begin committing it to memory and begin fully understanding the information. As the exam date approaches, allot more time for studying that subject. You may need some additional time to brush up on certain ideas or do a more comprehensive look at the material. Don't wait until the last minute to study for a test. When you know a test is coming up, start studying for it a week before the exam date. Don't wait on the teacher to give you a study guide to begin studying. Reread the chapter, review your notes, learn definitions and formulas. Don't stay up all night before an exam. If you are tired, you will not do well. Get a good night's sleep, eat a nutritious breakfast and lunch, and come to class early. Coming to class on time also ensures that you are not late to the exam. If the teacher gives any tips, flash reviews, or provides additional information, you will be in class to hear it. A common mistake students make is not reading the instructions or the questions carefully, and then making errors on the test. Take your time as you take the test. Read the directions for each section, then read each question. Ask your teacher if you are unclear about a question on the test. When you take a test, you neither want to rush or work too slow. Think about how long you have to finish, the number of questions, and the types of questions. You may want to tackle difficult or long sections first. If an essay is worth 1/4 of your overall test grade, you might want to write that first. Another strategy is to answer easy questions, saving questions you are unsure about for last. Many times, our initial impressions are correct, but then we second-guess ourselves until we write down the wrong answer. If you have a gut reaction to a question, then trust that instinct.

"Question: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A ""Bingo Star"". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan ""Attention, Baby!"" on it. Question: Is Benedykt popular among his employees? Options: - Yes, they like him because he can play golf   - No, they hate him   - not enough information   - Yes, they love him because he's a good leader === The correct answer is

(September 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The movie begins with Eugene (Zach Cregger) and his best friend Tucker (Trevor Moore) as kids. They sneak into the bedroom closet of Eugene's brother, as he recently acquired a valuable Michael Jordan rookie card. Upon opening the box the card was in, Tucker notices that Eugene's brother has an issue of Playboy. Tucker opens the magazine, instantly becoming obsessed with it. Three weeks later, Tucker's demeanor has changed to that of a hormone driven teenager, despite that he is only 8 years old. Fast forward ten years later, Eugene and Tucker are seniors in high school. Tucker is still a huge fan of the Playboy franchise, while Eugene and his girlfriend of two years, Cindi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) are public speakers on the subject of abstinence for younger teens. Despite this, in reality, Cindi has other plans, stating that since they have been together for two years, if she is not Eugene's first then they have big problems. They decide to go through with it at the after prom party that Tucker had invited them to. On the day of prom, Tucker tells Eugene that he has the limo booked, which when pulls up, has already picked up Tucker's high school drop-out friend, Phil, who now goes by the MC name of Horsedick.MPEG (Craig Robinson). At the After Prom party, Cindi goes upstairs to prepare, while Tucker takes Eugene into the kitchen and gives him several shots of hard alcohol. As Eugene leaves to go upstairs to meet Cindi, he walks through the wrong door, and falls down the steps into the basement. He is hurt so bad, that he falls into a coma for four years. After Tucker wakes Eugene with a baseball bat, he tells him that Cindi stuck around for a little while, but disappeared shortly thereafter because Eugene was ""a vegetable.""

"Summarize this article in one sentence.

The Pharaohs suffered a shock 1-0 loss away to Chad in the first leg of their tie last week but will have home advantage on Tuesday to help them erase the deficit.
Ezechiel Ndouassel scored Chad's winner, which also gave new coach Rigobert Song a brilliant start to his reign.
While the odds are against Chad completing the job, former Cameroon midfielder Song will be hoping his side can produce another stunning upset.
Ghana, Algeria and Nigeria also came away from road trips with surprise results as they were all held by opponents they had been expected to beat.
The Black Stars' 0-0 draw with Comoros - the lowest ranked African side still in the qualifiers and 159 places below Ghana - was, perhaps, the most embarrassing result suffered by the continent's big names.
Captain Asamoah Gyan is in determined mood to make amends.
""We know we were not up to the task in the first game so we will make sure we turn things around, "" he said.
Algeria, who have only just lost their place as Africa's number one side, also need to put in a strong display with their tie with Tanzania level at 2-2.
The two away goals give the Desert Foxes an advantage but they will have been disappointed that their defence was breached twice.
Tanzania had taken a two-goal lead in the first match only for Islam Slimani to rescue Algeria with a brace. The striker will want to finish the job in Blida.
While Nigeria did not concede in their first leg with Swaziland, the Super Eagles will be concerned by their lack of goals.
Coach Sunday Oliseh was rocked by the retirement of striker Emmanuel Emenike last month and he must quickly find a forward line that will provide a cutting edge.
Oliseh played with three strikers against Swaziland and he brought on Obafemi Martins and Kelechi Iheanacho in the second half. It will be interesting to see how he sets his team up for the game in Port Harcourt.
Kenya have hurt their chances of protecting their 1-0 lead over Cape Verde after a row over payments delayed their departure. The Harambee Stars, who have a nine-hour flight, will arrive less than 24 hours before kick-off.
Elsewhere, Mali face a shock elimination unless they can overturn a 2-1 deficit against Botswana. Mali have finished third in the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 and 2013 and were heavy favourites to knock out the Zebras.
Senegal should see off the challenge of Madagascar, who achieved a superb 2-2 draw in the first leg but are unlikely to be able to resist the Teranga Lions on their own ground.
The 2002 World Cup quarter-finalists will look to their big names, such as first-leg scorers Mame Biram Diouf and Sadio Mane, to dominate the India Ocean island side.
The 14 overall winners will join the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon,  Guinea, Morocco, Uganda and Zambia in the group stage, which kicks off next October.

"Article: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a quasi-independent agency of the United States Government. It appears to have multiple leadership. On the one hand its director is appointed by the president. It plays a significant role in providing the president with intelligence. On the other hand, Congress oversees its operations through a committee. The CIA was first formed under the National Security Act of 1947 from the army's Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which furnished both military intelligence and clandestine military operations to the army during the crisis of World War II. Many revisions and redefinitions have taken place since then. Although the name of the CIA reflects the original advised intent of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, the government's needs for strategic services have frustrated that intent from the beginning. The press received by the agency in countless articles, novels and other media have tended to create various popular myths; for example, that this agency replaced any intelligence effort other than that of the OSS, or that it contains the central intelligence capability of the United States. Strategic services are officially provided by some 17 agencies called the Intelligence Community. Army intelligence did not come to an end; in fact, all the branches of the Armed Forces retained their intelligence services. This community is currently under the leadership (in addition to all its other leadership) of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

"Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The ""indie"" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it. These days, I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that is too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (I am talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).

"Q:Information:  - Surra (from the Marathi ""sra"", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically ""Trypanosoma evansi"", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated.  - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus ""Trypanosoma"".  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions ""assassin bug"", ""cone-nose bug"", and ""kissing bug"") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.  - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan ""Trypanosoma cruzi"". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. ""T. cruzi"" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking ""kissing bugs"" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: ""vinchuca"" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, ""barbeiro"" (the barber) in Brazil, ""pito"" in Colombia, ""chinche"" in Central America, and ""chipo"" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for ""T. cruzi"" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...  - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad.  - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called ""enzymology"".  - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi . It is classified under EC 3.4.22.51 .  - In organic chemistry, a thiol is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl or sulphydryl (CSH or RSH) group (where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of ""thion"" + ""alcohol,"" with the first word deriving from Greek  (""theion"") = ""sulfur"". The SH functional group itself is referred to as either a ""thiol group"" or a ""sulfhydryl group"".

Q: Passage: On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler.
When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to ""I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.""
Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house. In the basement, Sarah discovers the family's dismembered dog. Miles apologizes, and explains that someone is invading his dreams every night, and that he has to ""make room."".

She is finally cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II German uniforms.The movie then moves to seven medical students on Easter vacation. They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her. He finds the body of the hiker in his tent, but then falls through snow into a cave below.The other students find an old wooden box filled with valuables and German decorations hidden under the floor. They consider taking and selling it, but eventually put it back, although some of them keep items. After it gets dark, one of the students, Chris (Jenny Skavlan), goes to the outhouse, but is murdered while on the toilet.

"Thierry Daniel Henry (French pronunciation:  [tjeRi aRi]; born 17 August 1977) is a retired French professional footballer who played as a forward and is the second assistant manager of the Belgium national team. He played for Monaco, Juventus, Barcelona, New York Red Bulls and spent eight years at Arsenal where he is the club's all-time record goalscorer. At international level he represented France and is his country's record goalscorer. Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994.

On 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season. His base salary of $5 million ($5.6 million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in the MLS--surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75 million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4 million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35 million compared to Keane's $4.33 million.  On 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5-2 Red Bulls win over the Montreal Impact. He was named MLS Player of the Month that same month. On 27 October 2013, Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the Chicago Fire at Red Bull Arena to help his team win 5-2 and become champions of the regular season. It was the club's first major trophy in their 17-year history.  On 12 July 2014, Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4-1 Red Bulls win over the Columbus Crew. With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37, surpassing Amado Guevara and Tab Ramos.  On 1 December 2014, it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club. On 16 December, he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:

The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash's son helps them escape.

China Unicom Boycott of Google May Signal Fallout Is Spreading 
  
 (For more stories about Google in China, see {EXTR <GO>}.) 
  
 By Mark Lee 
  
 March 25 (Bloomberg) -- China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.’s boycott of Google Inc.’s search engine signals the fallout from the U.S. company’s defiance of government censorship is spreading, analysts said. 
  
 Unicom doesn’t use Google search boxes on its phones and only works with companies that abide by Chinese law, President Lu Yimin told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong. On March 23, billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Tom Online Inc. said it stopped using Google on its portal. 
  
 “If you were partnering with Google in China, your business plans have just fallen apart,” Bertram Lai, head of research at CIMB-GK Securities in Hong Kong, said by phone. “You need to scramble and find new partners.” 
  
 Google’s decision to stop censoring its Chinese service has spurred speculation that advertisers may switch to rival search engines such as that of Baidu Inc. In the U.S., Go Daddy Group Inc., the world’s largest registrar of domain names, said yesterday it’s refusing to offer new site identities in China, citing increased Internet spying by the government on its citizens. 
  
 Chinese partners for Google’s search operations need to review their business ties as the U.S. company’s Internet service license in China needs to be renewed soon, said Fang Meiqin, research director at BDA China Ltd., a Beijing-based telecommunications industry consultant. 
  
 Sale Postponed 
  
 Google said in January that it postponed to an unspecified date the sale of two handsets co-developed with Unicom, after the U.S. company said its stand on Internet censorship may lead to its exit from China. Lu denied Unicom was involved in the phones’ development. 
  
 “Unicom has dropped Google from its handset plans because Google no longer operates within China,” Lai, who rates Unicom shares “underperform,” said. “It makes sense for them to make the decision immediately” to avoid the costs of reprogramming handsets to remove Google later, he said. 
  
 Mountain View, California-based Google, which has partnerships with China Mobile Ltd. and Sina Corp., said March 22 it began routing China-based subscribers to an unfiltered search service on its Hong Kong site, following through on a Jan. 12 statement to end self-censorship of its Google.cn portal. 
  
 Google’s redirection of its search queries is effectively a pullout from China, reducing the appeal for advertisers, Steven Chang, the Shanghai-based chief executive officer for China at Zenith Optimedia, which buys ads from Google and Baidu on behalf of clients, said in an interview this week. 
  
 ‘Advertisers Will Switch” 
  
 “If traffic at Google’s Hong Kong site is not as good as the Chinese site, advertisers will switch,” Elinor Leung, head of Internet research at CLSA Ltd., said this week. Chinese companies including Baidu, Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Sohu.com Inc. will benefit, she said. 
  
 Baidu, operator of the country’s biggest search engine, rose 2.3 percent to $608.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, while Sohu dropped 1.9 percent. 
  
 Elaine Feng, executive vice-president at Tom Online, said the company only works with partners that are compliant with regulations. She said the Chinese Internet company ended its relationship with Google after the expiry of an agreement, without giving details on the timing. 
  
 Go Daddy’s announcement came two days after Google said it stopped self-censorship. Christine Jones, executive vice president and general counsel of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based registrar, disclosed the company’s change in policy at a hearing of a congressionally mandated commission yesterday in Washington. 
  
 Partnerships 
  
 Google teamed with China Mobile in January 2007 to offer mobile and Internet services in the world’s most populous country. The U.S. firm also struck a partnership with Sina to provide search on China’s third-most visited Web portal. 
  
 Rainie Lei, spokeswoman at China Mobile, didn’t reply to e- mail and phone messages seeking comment. Cathy Peng, a spokeswoman at Sina declined to say if the company plans to retain its search agreement with Google. 
  
 Baidu, based in Beijing, accounted for 58.6 percent of China’s online search market last quarter, compared with 35.6 percent for Google, according to research company Analysys International.

 To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net ||||| China’s second-largest mobile operator has announced it will remove Google’s search function from new handsets developed with the US company in the first concrete fallout of the clash with Beijing over internet censorship. 
  
 China Unicom said the Google search function would not be provided on phones using the US company’s Android-based operating system. Unicom said the handsets’ manufacturers would choose which search engines to use instead. 
  
 “We are willing to work with any company that abides by Chinese law . . . we don’t have any co-operation with Google currently,” said Lu Yimin, Unicom’s president. 
  
 The Chinese government has struggled in recent days to respond to Google’s decision to redirect Chinese users of its search function to its uncensored Hong Kong site. 
  
 Internet users using Google have experienced widely divergent search results in different parts of the country and at different times of the day, in part a reflection of splits in the Chinese government over how to react to the US group’s move. 
  
 But Unicom’s statement is confirmation that Google’s stance against censorship in China could carry a substantial commercial cost, through its exclusion from the fast-growing mobile internet market in the country. 
  
 According to official Chinese figures, the country has 384m internet users, but 745m mobile subscribers, many of them regular users of the internet on their handsets. Last year, China Unicom and its two competitors started third-generation mobile businesses and have signed up millions on customers to the higher-end services. 
  
 In January, after announcing its intention to stop censoring its search engine in China, Google delayed the launches of two Android-based mobile handsets that Samsung and Motorola had developed for Unicom. 
  
 Unicom’s website has since started taking pre-orders for the Motorola device. China Unicom did not explain the delay or say when the phones would be launched. 
  
 Analysts said China Unicom was likely to take a blow from its decision. “Their distribution of the iPhone is not going very well, and therefore Android was an important part of their strategy,” said Charice Wang, an analyst at Ovum, the telecoms research company. 
  
 China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, offers more than a dozen smartphones running on its own platform which is based on Android and which feature Google as one search engine among others. So far, the company has not said whether it will drop Google. But last week, Wang Jianzhou, chairman, was already playing down the company’s co-operation with Google, saying that the two did not have an exclusive relationship. 
  
 “They are likely to switch to Baidu soon,” said Ms Wang, the Ovum analyst, referring to Google’s Chinese competitor in internet search. |||||

Review title: Didn't Last Long-No Customer Service Product review: I purchased this item last April and had used it only 8-10 times through the summer. It worked well (when it was operational) on small jobs that I needed done. However, in October I needed to do some maintenance on the pool but when I turned it on, the motor/blades (for lack of a better word) would barely turn, sounding as if the motor was freezing up. I contacted customer service twice (both times I got an answering machine) and have never received a call back. I gave up after reading the small print in the instruction booklet, as it says for returns you must have the original packing box. Of course, it's a catch-22; even if I still had the container, I couldn't get a call back. I was not impressed with the item or the (complete lack of) customer service. Order at your own risk.

"Article:Willem Holleeder is already in jail, pending trial in a number of cases involving the Amsterdam underworld.
The sisters, who testified against him in a murder case last year, say they are ""bewildered but not surprised"".
The suspect is also accused of plotting to murder crime reporter Peter de Vries. He denies all charges.
Dubbed ""The Nose"", 55-year-old Holleeder was already in custody facing murder and attempted murder charges, as well as belonging to a criminal organisation.
He was arrested in his cell in April over the alleged plot to kill his sisters after a tip-off from a fellow prisoner, prosecutors said.
""Holleeder allegedly already paid money and promised more, should his plans indeed be carried out,"" they added.
Appearing in court on Tuesday, Holleeder denied he had plans to kill his sisters and Mr de Vries.
""It's absolutely not in my interest that anything happens to them,"" he said.
When his sisters testified against him in a murder case last year, one of them said she was signing her death warrant.
Astrid Holleeder told the Dutch newspaper NRC she had hoped she would be safe after his arrest in 2014. But instinctively she knew he would not leave them alone.
""He doesn't tolerate opposition"", she told the paper. ""Willem wants revenge.""
Crime journalist Peter de Vries, who wrote a best-selling book about the Heineken kidnapping, also suspects revenge as the motive: ""He's let it be known several times that he's after me,"" he said.
Holleeder became a household name in the Netherlands for his role in the abduction of beer magnate Freddy Heineken and his driver more than three decades ago.
The two were released unharmed after a large ransom was paid.
Holleeder was sentenced to 11 years for the kidnapping, which became one of the country's best-known crime sagas and was turned into a movie last year.
He was arrested again in 2006 for extortion against two men who were later found dead, and released in 2012 after serving two thirds of his sentence.
He became a minor celebrity until he was re-arrested in December 2014, even appearing on TV and posing for pictures with fans on Amsterdam's beer terraces.

"Question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Why will stress be detrimental to a person? Options: - not enough information   - Not allowing time for recovery   - Focusing on varied and interesting life experiences   - Allowing it to be a part of life balance === The correct answer is

"Proud of her job: Rebekah Brooks leaving the Phone Hacking trial at the Old Bailey in London. Rebekah Brooks spent £159,000 to buy the story of a prostitute caught performing a sex act on Hugh Grant, the phone-hacking trial heard yesterday. Divine Brown was paid $100,000 (£64,000) directly by the News of the World for her sordid story and the tabloid lavished another £95,000 flying her and her entire family by private jet to a luxury resort in the Nevada desert. Brooks, then the features editor, said this was to prevent rival newspapers spoiling their exclusive story about Grant. But she denied there was a ‘dark arts department’ for phone hacking at the News of the World, which she later edited. Brooks, 45, told the Old Bailey she knew nothing of the illegal interception of voicemails by the tabloid’s private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and had never heard his name mentioned when she was editor. It was her first chance to defend herself after four months of prosecution claims that she was central in a conspiracy at the News of the World and The Sun to hack phones and to corrupt public officials. While recounting her rapid rise through the ‘old school misogyny’ of the newspaper world, Brooks told how as the News of the World’s features editor, her speciality was buying up celebrities for exclusive stories. When Four Weddings And A Funeral star Grant was arrested with Miss Brown in a car on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard in June 1995, the paper’s US editor and a colleague managed to track down the prostitute after she was released from custody. Brooks said she spent her entire weekly budget of £60,000 chartering a plane for Miss Brown – real name Estella Marie Thompson – and her family. ‘Miss Brown had been traced to her family home by one of the paper’s reporters, a former private investigator, after her arrest with Mr Grant in Los Angeles. Divine Brown: Flown into hiding. Hugh Grant: Arrested in LA in 1995. ‘We flew them to a place in Nevada – the desert’, she added, breaking into laughter. ‘It seems silly now, but it was really important. ‘She was very smart. She wanted all her family relocated so we had to hire a plane because there were so many of them... it ended up costing around $200,000... $250,000. It was probably one of the biggest expenses I had done, which is why I have a relatively clear memory of it.’ She later had to explain the ‘huge cost’ to the paper’s editor and managing editor. Brooks moved to The Sun in January 1998 and said she brought her contacts with her. One was Spurs footballer Paul Gascoigne, whom she paid £50,000 to £80,000 for an exclusive interview about his domestic violence towards his former wife Sheryl. She also ‘dealt a lot’ with PR guru Max Clifford, who ‘brokered stories’ to her. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks leave the court. Brooks – one of the most influential women in Britain until her arrest over the hacking allegations – had smiled as she entered the witness box, moments after hearing one of the charges against her had been dropped. Dressed in a demure cream cardigan with pearl buttons and a knee-length royal blue shift dress, and with her red curls pinned back off her face, she spoke softly and hesitantly of how her career began sweeping newsroom floors and making tea but took her into the corridors of power by the age of 29. It included meetings with Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson before they entered Government and careers advice from Rupert Murdoch. The media tycoon entered her office when she was appointed deputy editor at the News of the World and told her: ‘You’ve got a long career ahead, take your time and learn on the job.’ He told her to avoid publicity and that he did not want her ‘spouting forth opinions’ on current affairs programmes. She said: ‘He gave good advice – you are a newspaper executive, it’s hard work, keep your head down.’ Initially faltering and hesitant, Brooks had been warned she was likely to spend a long time in the witness box. She appeared to grow in composure as she was challenged directly about the phone-hacking allegations. The jury has heard that Mulcaire has admitted targeting dozens of celebrities on the orders of former News of the World journalists Greg Miskiw and Neville Thurlbeck. The three have admitted conspiring to hack phones. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, asked her if she had ever heard any of her journalists talk about Mulcaire while she was editor, between May 2000 and January 2003. ‘No,’ she answered immediately. She said she had known the tabloid used private detectives – as did  other newspapers, City firms and lawyers – but insisted she had never heard Mulcaire’s name mentioned, nor had any knowledge of his involvement in phone hacking. Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had alleged she had established an investigations unit dubbed the ‘dark arts department’ specifically to hack phones. ‘That’s not true,’ Brooks replied, adding: ‘I don’t recognise that description.’ Brooks said she was proud of the undercover work carried out by the News of the World, which had been in the public interest. She told the jury it was ‘impossible’ for an editor to know the source for every article in their newspaper. She described the ‘incredibly competitive’ atmosphere inside the tabloid – once Britain’s best-selling newspaper – and said her rapid promotion had exposed her to sexist jibes. ‘There was probably a bit of old school misogyny added into the competition there would have been if I was a bloke,’ she said. ‘The competitiveness was engrained into the News of the World... It was a tough world.’ Brooks denies four charges of conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and her former lover, ex-News of the World Andy Coulson, watched from the dock as she gave her evidence. They also deny all the charges against them. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

"Here is a question about this article: The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s, particularly electric blues, which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a ""grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound"" on records such as James Cotton's ""Cotton Crop Blues"" (1954). Other antecedents include Link Wray's instrumental ""Rumble"" in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as ""Let's Go Trippin'"" (1961) and ""Misirlou"" (1962).

"Article: Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner as flat-ironing hair may cause damage to your hair. Shampooing and conditioning will remove unwanted oil and product build-up from your hair.  Look for shampoo and conditioner products that are sulfate-free and jam packed with glycerin. Glycerin helps reduce frizz as it penetrates hair follicles, hydrating hair from the inside out. The closer glycerin is to the front of the ingredients list, the more it contains.  Use a gentle shampoo and a smoothing conditioner. Straightening can be damaging to hair, even if your hair is thick and curly, so gentle products are important. When leaving in the conditioner in the shower, use a paddle brush to comb through your hair. This will help with the smoothening process while in the shower. Co-washing means washing your hair with only conditioner. Hair that's thick or curly is prone to more dryness than average hair. If your hair is very dry and frizzy, you should try co-washing your hair before straightening it. Your hair may benefit from being co-washed a few times a week.  Shampoo can remove a lot of the natural moisture from hair. Using conditioner may reduce your hair's dryness. As straightening your hair can cause it to dry out, co-washing may be very helpful for someone with thick or curly hair. To co-wash your hair, saturate your hair with water. Then, massage in your chosen conditioner. Give your hair three to five minutes to absorb the conditioner and then wash it out. Do not rub! Wet hair is very weak and prone to damage. Blot the hair gently, and lightly wring the ends to soak-up moisture. Dry until it is slightly damp.  Pat the hair downwards to promote straightening. Towel-drying in different directions enhances curls.  Allow your hair to dry 90% of the way before you blow-dry. Concentrated hot air can frizz your hair. If you don't have either, use a small amount of the conditioner or a dime-sized amount of olive oil. These coat your hair to prevent the intense heat from causing split ends.  Don’t overdo it. Too much leave-in conditioner can make your hair limp instead of straight. Wash your hair with only conditioner twice a week to keep from washing away natural hair oils. Use argan oil for thick hair.

How Clean is Your Spinach? 
  
 Researchers believe peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables 
  
 Share this article: 
  
 Nichola Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researher at UC Riverside. 
  
 RIVERSIDE, Calif. (www.ucr.edu) — Ever wonder what the words triple-washed or pre-washed on a bag of baby spinach mean? 
  
 Not much according to engineers at the University of California, Riverside. They discovered that small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables. 
  
 Currently, disinfectant is put into the rinse water, and not specifically applied to the leaf surface. The researchers in the Bourns College of Engineering found that because of the varied topography of the spinach leaf nearly 15 percent of the leaf surface may reach concentrations as low as 1,000 times that of the bleach disinfectant being used to rinse it. 
  
 As a result, as the leaves move through the processing facility after being rinsed the bacteria may continue to live, grow, spread, and contaminate other leaves and surfaces within the facility. 
  
 Following rinsing under the low bleach condition, upwards of 90 percent of adhered bacteria were observed to remain attached to and survive on the leaf surface. 
  
 “In a sense the leaf is protecting the bacteria and allowing it to spread,” said Nichola M. Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researcher working with Sharon Walker, a professor of chemical and environmental engineering. “It was surprising to discover how the leaf surface formed micro-environments that reduce the bleach concentration and in this case the very disinfection processes intended to clean, remove, and prevent contamination was found to be the potential pathway to amplifying foodborne outbreaks.” 
  
 Kinsinger will present her research on August 19 at the 250th American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition. The talk is called, “Is our salad safe? Efficacy of disinfection techniques to decontaminate spinach leaves and reduce cross-contamination.” 
  
 Kinsinger is also writing a paper, co-authored by Walker and Madeline Luth, an undergraduate student, about the findings. It will soon be submitted for publication. 
  
 The Center for Disease Control estimates that 1 in 6 Americans become ill and 3,000 die annually from foodborne diseases. Additionally, this causes and an estimated over $75 billion per year loss for the food industry. 
  
 Past research has found about 20 percent of single food commodity outbreaks from 2003 to 2008 were attributed to leafy green produce. Contamination of such minimally processed and ready-to-eat produce is of concern since it is frequently consumed uncooked or raw. 
  
 One of these outbreaks, involving spinach, occurred in California in 2006. In all, 199 people in 26 states were infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli. Three died. 
  
 Currently, the industry standard is to add 50 to 200 parts per million of bleach to the water used to rinse leafy green vegetables. But that is just a recommendation, not a requirement or regulation, Kinsinger said. 
  
 For the research, Kinsinger and Walker designed a parallel plate flow chamber system to evaluate in real time the attachment and detachment of pathogens to the spinach in realistic water chemistries and flow conditions. 
  
 Their work focused exclusively on baby spinach, however the issue of reduced bleach concentration across the leaf surface and other surfaces within the processing facility translates beyond the specific scenarios tested and demonstrates the limitation of bleach disinfection causing significant concern over public health. 
  
 Future research will focus on a broader range of foods, surfaces in processing facilities and pathogen types, Kinsinger said. 
  
 Despite their findings, Kinsinger notes that the United States has one of safest food supply system. Still, she says, “I recommend rinsing those leaves.” 
  
 Kinsinger is a Riverside native who earned her bachelor’s and Ph.D. from UC Riverside. She has a postdoctoral research fellowship through the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture under the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Luth is a 2015-16 UCR Chancellor Research Fellow.

 Labels like “thoroughly washed” and “triple washed” make us feel comfortable chowing down on pre-washed baby spinach straight from the container. But researchers from the University of California, Riverside, say we might want to rethink that habit. 
  
 They discovered that the small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves can harbor bacteria — even during the washing process they often undergo in food-processing plants. This, researchers say, could be an important reason why there have been several outbreaks of E. coli and salmonella in pre-washed baby spinach. 
  
 The findings were presented Wednesday at the American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition. 
  
 Pre-washed baby spinach is typically treated using a bleach disinfectant. But, researchers discovered, the shape of the baby spinach leaf means that 15 percent of the leaf’s surface may only see a very small percentage of the disinfectant. That remaining bacteria, which can include E. coli, salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes, can survive, grow, and spread to the other leaves. 
  
 Here’s the freaky part: After researchers rinsed baby spinach leaves under the typical disinfectant, nearly 90 percent of bacteria were still attached to (and alive on) the leaf’s surface.

 While the news is shocking to most people, “this is not a surprise to many of us in the food safety arena,” Mike Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, tells Yahoo Health. 
  
 The danger in this bacteria remaining is that it can cause outbreaks of food-borne illness, which he says are more common than we realize. “There are many outbreaks that go unreported or uninvestigated because the CDC can’t investigate them all,” he says. 
  
 The realization that spinach could cause food-borne illness reached national consciousness in 2006, when nearly 200 people from 26 states were infected with a strain of E. coli contracted from fresh spinach. Three people died from that outbreak. Fresh spinach was also involved in an outbreak in 2012 that infected 33 people in five states.

 Unfortunately, washing your pre-washed baby spinach before eating it doesn’t make a difference, says Benjamin Chapman, PhD, an assistant professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University. 
  
 “Rinsing isn’t going to do a whole heck of a lot for food safety,” Chapman tells Yahoo Health — it just may remove dirt or other physical objects that you can see. Cooking the spinach, however, will kill potentially harmful bacteria. 
  
 But what about the whole “triple wash” label? Does that make pre-washed spinach safer? Chapman says there’s some confusion about what it means. Companies don’t triple wash spinach to disinfect it, he explains — they do it to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination from one piece of spinach to another during the washing process. 
  
 So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts are mixed. Doyle says he doesn’t eat raw spinach because of the risks, but Chapman eats pre-washed baby spinach out of the bag. 
  
 “From a health standpoint, eating fruits and vegetables sometimes outweighs the risk,” Chapman says. However, he says he wouldn’t feed raw spinach to a person who is immunocompromised or elderly, just to be safe.

"Given the below context:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, ""Ordinary Love"", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single ""Invisible"", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a ""sneak preview"" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called ""the largest album release of all time."" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US$100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...  Guess a valid title for it!

"White House Ignoring Its Own Call for Civil Rhetoric?
This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" September 6, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: It took 24 hours but at long last, the White House has issued a response to the shocking remarks that were delivered by the Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa, who urged an amped-up union crowd to quote, ""Take those Tea Party sons of bitches out.""

Now ""The Anointed One"" has been calling on you and me to tone down the heated rhetoric since January. But as usual, he and his team, they don't practice what they preach.

Now here's what the White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer told WMAL radio earlier today.

DAN PFEIFFER, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I think that this is a bit of a parlor game in Washington which is, let's try to take anything that anyone who supports politicians, or the president or -- candidates says, and pin it on them and make the, you know, the president have to serve as the speech police for the Democratic Party and someone in the Republican...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: But Dan, he said that he has an army ready to do the president's bidding. And it was time to take the SOBs out. That's a sort of a harsh thing that you should say before the president of the United States speaks. The president has called for, you know, a greater and higher political discourse in this country. This doesn't seem to meet the standard.

PFEIFFER: Well, look, that's a judgment for you guys to make. It is a judgment for others to make.

HANNITY: Now, I have a judgment. The president is more than happy to serve as the chief of the speech police that's for conservatives, for Republicans, for me, for you, of course, members of the Tea Party Movement, just not for members of his own party. Maxine Waters, ""you can go straight to hell."" Frederica Wilson, thinks you are the real enemy. His own vice president who referred to the Tea Party members as terrorists.

And joining me now with reaction, the author of the terrific brand new book called, it's called ""A Point in Time: The Search for Redemption in This Life and the Next,"" David Horowitz. The co-host of ""The Five,"" always getting in trouble, always having to be defended is our own Bob Beckel.

Bob, good to see you.

BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Good to see you.

HANNITY: David, good to see you, too.

DAVID HOROWITZ, AUTHOR, ""A POINT IN TIME"": Hey.

HANNITY: Congrats on the book. This was -- the guy who wrote the art of political war, this is it. This is what we are talking about here. And this is a far more reflective book and a lot of your wisdom.

Let me ask you this. Bob Beckel, when Hoffa says, you know, we are at war with them, we are going to take those sons of bitches out, we need jobs. Most Americans are not union members. He's talking about unions, not talking about the American people, the 15 million Americans that are out of work, the other Americans that are under employed, is he?

BECKEL: Listen. I really can't quite get what the big deal is here. I mean, I know Jimmy Hoffa and he is not a guy who is a soft spoken guy. Now, would I have used those words now that I have finished calling the Tea Party all the names I could call them, I now call a truce. And I don't call them that. I say they are Tea people and that is fine.

Now, but what Hoffa was talking about was, what I said, is let's stop calling them names and let's get to win the war with them, and that war is in the elections because that's where we are going to beat them.

And by the way, the Tea Party doesn't represent much in America. Right now, they had a poll out today, among Republicans, they're half, what, positive and negative about the Tea Party.

HANNITY: All right. Let's go to a montage of the president, David. I'll get your reaction about -- the issue here is the double standard, the hypocrisy. Here's President Obama calling for civility again and again.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, JAN. 12: Only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation.

JIMMY HOFFA, PRESIDENT, TEAMSTERS, SEPT. 5: Let's take these son of a (bleep) out.

OBAMA, JAN. 12: We can question each other's ideas without questioning each other's love of country.

REP. FREDERICA WILSON, D-FLA., AUG. 23: Let's all remember who the real enemy is.

OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: I do hope that we will talk with each other and not over each other.

WILSON, AUG. 23: The real enemy is the Tea Party.

OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Where we do disagree, let's disagree over things that are real. Not these wild misrepresentations.

REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF., AUG. 23: The Tea Party can go straight to hell.

OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: People who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks.

VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, SEPT. 5: You are the only folks keeping the barbarians in the gate.

OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Create bogeyman out there that just aren't real.

HOROWITZ: Well, when it comes Sean, to bold-face lying to the American people, Barack Obama makes Bill Clinton look like a boy scout. I've never seen a president lie with such aplomb and so consistently over so long a time as Barack Obama.

It is totally hypocritical. And you know, Bob put a kind of nice spin on the Hoffa speech. This is the language of warfare. This is so destructive to a democracy. Our politics has become unbelievably ugly. And the Democrats for reasons actually, I don't refer to Democrats, but I explain in my book, people on the left are basically in a religious movement. They want to see a redemption in this life. And they see conservatives like us, we are the party of Satan for them. And that's the way they treat us. Whereas conservatives tend to be on the whole, civil, they give people the benefit of the doubt and they are.

BECKEL: Excuse me, I'm sorry.

HOROWITZ: It is OK, we forgive you.

"The Club Players Association was officially launched on Monday and a news conference was told that its main aim is a more meaningful programme with a shorter season.
""Players want to play games,"" said CPA chairman Micheal Briody.
""They don't want endless training sessions and 13-month seasons.""
Mr Briody added that players feel ""last in line after administrators, CCC members, coaches, paid managers have all had their say"".
""This is fundamentally a player welfare issue and together the time has come to address it before we do irreparable damage.
""Since the idea of the CPA was first floated in the autumn we have been inundated with emails and calls from club players expressing their frustration at the way in which our fixtures are managed,"" added Briody, who is chairman of the St Brigids club in Meath.
The new club players' body is not yet officially recognised but a Wexford motion calling for this to happen is due to be debated at next month's annual GAA Congress.
CPA secretary and former Monaghan selector Declan Brennan added that the GAA's current fixtures programme ""is a mess"".
""Other less important issues have been given prominence,"" added the CPA secretary.
""Players want regular meaningful games, they want to enjoy our games and they want some downtime during a recognised closed season.""

Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona. Its lead single, ""Better the Devil You Know"" peaked at number two in the UK and four in her native Australia. Rhythm of Love's second and fourth single, ""Step Back in Time"" and ""Shocked"" were both a top ten hit in the UK and Australia. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991. Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It was released in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, ""Word Is Out"", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, subsequent singles ""If You Were with Me Now"" and ""Give Me Just a Little More Time"" both reached the top five. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October.

"Summarize the following:
Use your fingers to work the oily substance into the fur around the gum. Make sure the affected area is completely covered.  If your dog licks off some of the peanut butter, it's okay, as long as you use a peanut butter that doesn't contain xylitol.  Dogs can eat other oils, as well. However, try to keep your dog from licking at the oil, as they may get diarrhea or suffer from pancreatitis if they consume too much. This gives it time to soak into the gum, loosening it. Sit with your dog so you can make sure it doesn't snack on the oily substance or the gum. Keep the chewed gum out of the dog's mouth. Sugar-free gum is harmful to dogs because it contains xylitol. Although regular gum is usually harmless to dogs, it's best to play it safe. Insert the teeth of the comb down into the fur just above the gum. Then, pull the comb down through the fur to dislodge the gum. If the gum doesn't come out easily, apply more oil.  You can also pick the gum out with your fingers. If there is still gum caught on your dog's fur, you may need to apply more peanut butter, olive oil, butter, or mayonnaise. If 2 to 3 applications don't work, you may need to trim the dog's fur. Rub dog shampoo into the pup's fur, working it into the affected area. Then, rinse your dog thoroughly to remove any remaining soap. Dry your pup with a clean, dry towel. Use a degreasing shampoo, if possible. It will more easily remove the oil. As an alternative, wash the affected area with dish soap before you wash the dog.

He also kept three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium. Blofeld comments that the fish naturally fight each other, but while two are fighting, there's always one that holds back until the other two stop. Then, that cunning fish attacks the weakened victor and kills it easily. Thus SPECTRE's main strategy is to instigate conflict between two powerful enemies, hoping that they will exhaust themselves and be vulnerable when SPECTRE moves to seize power.Kronsteen devises a plot to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets and sell it back to them, while exacting revenge on Bond for killing their agent, Dr. No the previous year (in the first James Bond film).

"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed? ?  The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as ""the Balkan Prussia"". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The first All-Starr excursion led to the release of Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song ""I Call Your Name"" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.The following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on The Simpsons episode ""Brush with Greatness"" and contributed an original song, ""You Never Know"", to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film Curly Sue. In 1992, he released his first studio album in nine years, Time Takes Time, which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single ""Weight of the World"" peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking his first appearance on the singles chart there since ""Only You"" in 1974.In 1994, he began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the Beatles Anthology project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, ""Free as a Bird"" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, ""Real Love"". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney's 1997 album Flaming Pie. Among the tracks to which he contributed, ""Little Willow"" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while ""Really Love You"" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.In 1998, he released two albums on the Mercury label.

"Answer the following question: Information:  - Anatolia (from Greek , '  ""east"" or ""(sun)rise""; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  ""small Asia""; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Lucius Licinius Lucullus (118  57/56 BC) was an ""optimate"" politician of the late Roman Republic, closely connected with Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In the culmination of over twenty years of almost continuous military and government service, he became the main conqueror of the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship in diverse situations, most famously during the siege of Cyzicus, 73-72 BC, and at the Battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene, 69 BC. His command style received unusually favourable attention from ancient military experts, and his campaigns appear to have been studied as examples of skillful generalship.  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - There were three Mithridatic Wars between Rome and the Kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC. They are named for Mithridates VI who was King of Pontus at the time.  - The Kingdom of Pontus or Pontic Empire was a state founded by the Persian Mithridatic dynasty, which may have been directly related to Darius the Great and the Achaemenid dynasty. The kingdom was proclaimed by Mithridates I in 281BCE and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63BCE. It reached its largest extent under Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos, and for a brief time the Roman province of Asia. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic Wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province Bithynia et Pontus, and the eastern half survived as a client kingdom.  - Mithra (""Mira"", ""Miça"") is the Zoroastrian angelic Divinity (""yazata"") of Covenant and Oath. In addition to being the Divinity of Contracts, Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing Protector of Truth, and the Guardian of Cattle, the Harvest and of The Waters.  - Hegemony (or , or  ""leadership, rule"") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE  6th century CE), ""hegemony"" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the ""hegemon"".  - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories.  - A consul was the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic, and the consulship was considered the highest level of the ""cursus honorum"" (the sequential order of public offices through which aspiring politicians sought to ascend).  - Lucius Licinius Murena was Roman consul in 62 BC. His father had the same name.   - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC  28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname ""Magnus"", ""the Great"", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title ""Augustus"", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - The Second Mithridatic War ( 83 -- 81 BC ) was one of three wars fought between Pontus and the Roman Republic . The second Mithridatic war was fought between King Mithridates VI of Pontus and the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena . At the conclusion of the First Mithridatic War , Sulla had come to a hasty agreement with Mithridates that allowed the latter to remain in control of his Kingdom of Pontus , but relinquishing his claim to Asia Minor and respecting pre-war borders . Murena , as Sulla 's legate , was stationed in Asia as commander of the two legions formerly under the command of Gaius Flavius Fimbria . Murena invaded Pontus on his own authority claiming that Mithridates was re-arming and posed a direct threat to Roman Asia Minor . After several inconclusive skirmishes , Mithridates inflicted a minor defeat on Murena and forced his withdrawal from Pontus . Peace was restored on the orders of Sulla . This was followed by the Third Mithridatic War .  - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian ""Miradta"", ""gift of Mithra""; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus.    'second mithridatic war' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Assassin's Creed: Syndicate a return to form for Ubisoft's flagship gaming franchise

The writers for Assassin's Creed: Syndicate probably couldn't help themselves, really.

With the latest game in the long-running historical fiction series, Ubisoft finally gets its chance to make a James Bond joke amid the smoke and soot of London during the Industrial Revolution.

But there's far more at stake in what will be the series' 10th major instalment since 2007.

Ubisoft's studios in Montreal, Quebec City and Toronto needed to redeem themselves going into Syndicate's launch. Last year's instalment, Assassin's Creed: Unity, took place in Revolutionary-era Paris and was supposed to be a love letter to the developer's French roots. What gamers got instead was a flat plot and an astounding number of game-breaking glitches.

Syndicate hopes to right the ship by taking the series back to its roots: taking down enemies while staying hidden in a crowd and scaling history's greatest monuments with parkour moves completely inappropriate to the era.

The two main characters, twins Jacob and Evie Frye, are an instantly likable pair, and are given equal billing and importance throughout the game. (Ubisoft)

The overarching plot of the Creed series is, by now, a convoluted mess that thankfully remains on the sidelines.

Essentially, all human history revolves around a secret war between the good guy Assassins, who value individual freedom, over the bad guy Templars, who value order. The series spotlights Assassins throughout human history, uncovering how the factions' rivalry shaped, for example, the American and French revolutions.

Intermittent cut scenes set in the modern day reveal the Templars as a multinational corporation called Abstergo Industries and the Assassins as a small band of rebel hackers. This frame narrative has meandered for years thanks to changes in Ubisoft's creative direction, and only shows up in brief moments, instead giving centre stage to its Victorian hero and heroine, twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye, in 1868.

Jacob and Evie take it upon themselves to free London from a capitalistic kingpin named Crawford Starrick by dismantling his gang operations, freeing the child labourers in his factories and assassinating his lieutenants in flamboyant manner.

Syndicate's leads have an on-screen rapport that makes an instant impression on the player: Evie, the calm and cerebral sibling, trades verbal jabs with Jacob, a charismatic Han Solo-type, in nearly every cut scene they appear in.

They're two halves of a whole, two equals working toward a common goal, even as their disparate personalities drive them to separate targets and objectives. They're a far more impressive duo than last year's lovers and/or rivals Arno and Elise.

London is in the midst of the Industrial Revolution in Sydicate. Factories filled witth child workers belch smoke into the sky throughout the day and night. (Ubisoft)

The supporting cast of historical figures like Karl Marx, Alexander Graham Bell and Florence Nightingale pop in and out to give you missions throughout the game. Most of them are simply varying shades of ""eccentric,"" but they quickly build friendships with Jacob and Evie and end up far more memorable than the majority of the last instalments' casts.

Ubisoft seems to have responded to criticisms that the series has had too few playable and prominent female characters. Evie's role is as prominent as Jacob's, and you can play the lion's share of the game as either character.

Non-player characters show surprising diversity as well, including the Fryes' ally, Indian immigrant Henry Green, and Ned Wynert, a transgender thief and informant.

Syndicate features a transgender character named Ned (nee Henrietta) Wynert, a rarity in video games. (Ubisoft)

For all of Jacob and Evie's playful banter, it's taken for granted why or how this generally jaunty duo can gleefully stab hundreds of gangsters and petty thieves to death in the streets, in front of crowds of screaming citizens.

We know even less about when they learned the Assassins' trademark ability to climb every vertical surface known to man, making London's rooftops their personal playground and scaling with little more than a window frame as a handhold.

But this is an Assassin's Creed video game, and like any mega-budget action movie these days, no one's here to learn about people's feelings: they want to see moustache-twirling bad guys get their comeuppance by getting stabbed in the carotid artery.

London, like any other Creed playground, is giant and dense, filled with missions to complete, thugs to beat up and collectibles to pick up for little reason other than they are there to be collected.

London's cathedrals and other architectural landmarks are recreated in meticulous detail. (Ubisoft)

This time around, though, there's more variety to your objectives, and the missions gamers have played for years now (like tailing a spy while avoiding getting spotted yourself) reappear only occasionally.

The Fryes' best gadget might not impress Bond's head of research Q, but it's a godsend for longtime players: a rope launcher can be used Batman-like to propel yourself to the top of buildings, or form zip-lines to race across chasms faster than you can say Nik Wallenda.

Returning from its introduction in Unity, key assassination missions present multiple options on how to take down your target. In an early standout, you have to infiltrate the Lambeth Asylum to kill John Elliotson, a real-life physician and mesmerist, portrayed as a psychotic with a penchant for public vivisections.

You can simply walk into his class and shank him in the stomach. But if you want to embrace your comically absurd side you can dump a cadaver in a closet and lie on the gurney yourself, covered by a sheet until the perfect moment to turn the tables on the doctor.

Hand-to-hand combat in the Creed games has always felt sluggish in comparison to the best in the genre, but Ubisoft has tightened the mechanics so that punching, dodging and stabbing feel more responsive than before.

The feel is thanks in part to state-of-the-art motion capture technology that mimics the actors' original movements. Evie smashes her opponents' faces with Ronda Rousey-like intensity, while Jacob bobs and weaves with his knuckles and knives like a slinky made out of razor wire.

Alexander Graham Bell is one of several historical figures you meet on your journey through London. (Ubisoft)

For gamers who have been following the series for years, Assassin's Creed: Syndicate's biggest surprise may be that it's better, not worse, than the games that came before it. The missions are more fun. The characters are more fully fleshed out. The glitches have been ironed out – for the most part.

What's left is one of Ubisoft's best games in years and proof that it's still fun to be a historical tourist armed to the teeth once in a while.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Input: Review: I admit that I am a vampire addict: I have seen so many vampire movies I have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed by the original John Carpenter's Vampires and when I descovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it. This movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and I felt that it built nicely on the original.Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favourite parts was just after he meets Zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. His comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.The other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. It is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night. There are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.If you like vampire movies I would recommend this one. If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.

"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: wishful thinking and misinformed Product review: Murray, like Gardner and Crowley, was one of those early eclectics about her study of the Old Religion. There is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for her conclusions on the development of the ""Witch God."" The first chapter, however, is a great read following the earliset depictions of the horned god. But the jump to stating that these depictions from all over Europe at varying times are linked to a single cohesive religion is tenuous. This is yet another case in which the author has made the facts fit her conception rather than objectively trying to make connections between the facts. This is the case, unfortunately, for almost all early expositors of witchcraft and the Old Religion. Read the more scholarly ""Triumph of the Moon"" by Ronald Hutton if you're looking for objectivity rather than charlatanism.

"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping $8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen. Question: How does the speaker feel about hot weather? Options:  A. S/he prefers moderate temperatures.  B. not enough information  C. S/he doesn't know the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  D. Temperatures along the Florida coast are so high they threaten the viability of many biological species.

"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output ""Can't answer"". Question: How does Ryan know Alissa out? Title: House at the End of the Street Movie plot: A young psychotic girl murders her parents with a hammer in the middle of a stormy night. Four years later, a newly divorced woman, medical doctor Sarah Cassidy (Elisabeth Shue), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move to a small, upscale town. Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter. The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts dating Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Ann by allowing her to fall from a swing when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting brain damage from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder. Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) in a hidden room. When she, Ann, escapes, Ryan accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to the diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy (Jordan Hayes). Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started. She finds tampons in the kitchen garbage and explores the house with suspicion until she finds the secret room and is attacked by Carrie-Ann, who is revealed to actually be Peggy. Ryan restrains ""Carrie-Ann"" while frantically screaming at Elissa to leave. Elissa finds blue contact lenses and Peggy Jones's wallet in the kitchen. Ryan has kidnapped the waitress and attempted to make her look like Carrie-Ann. When Elissa tries to leave, Ryan knocks her out by hitting her...

"– Toyota has introduced an odd new product, and no, it's not a car. The Japan-based automotive manufacturer just unveiled the Kirobo Mini, a small, humanoid robot designed to ""invoke an emotional connection,"" according to chief design engineer Fuminori Kataoka. Toyota's robot is one of a ""growing list"" of companion devices coming out in the country, which is suffering population contraction due to a plethora of social factors, including a general lack of interest in marriage and children among young Japanese, Reuters reports. With a lack of caretakers for an increasingly elderly population, the country is turning to robots to fill the gap. The Kirobo Mini itself doesn't offer any functionality beyond companionship, though the palm-sized robot ""wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself,"" Kataoka says. It also comes with a ""cradle"" of sorts, designed to fit in the cupholder of one's car. According to Digital Trends, the Kirobo Mini was inspired by a larger robot Toyota made as a companion for a Japanese astronaut aboard the ISS. Toyota's betting the concept will be a hit down here on Earth, too, and it must be confident, as the device is priced at a whopping 39,800 yen (roughly $392), plus a $3 monthly subscription. The device will go on sale next year in Japan. (Robots tried to write a Beatles song, and kind of pulled it off.)

– Egyptian police fired water cannons at protesters outside the Interior Ministry today, in the latest application of a new law that forbids any protest not approved by the government at least three days in advance. The law also gives the Interior Ministry the right to forbid any public meeting of more than 10 people, Reuters reports, and it forbids entirely any protest at a place of worship. If anything, the law has inspired more protests. Muslim Brotherhood supporters in several cities took to the streets today. Elsewhere in Cairo, female students at the pro-government Al-Azhar University for Islamic Learning stormed the dean's office and destroyed her desk today. A day earlier, students teamed with another school for a protest that police dispersed with tear gas, in the first application of the law. The law has also drawn condemnation from human rights groups; Amnesty International said it ""poses a grave threat to freedom of assembly and give security forces free rein to use excessive force.""

Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill _ . Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think.

"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the original name of the person whose early work was published primarily in magazines?, using the article: André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period., what would be the answer ?

"Q:Information:  - Alla breve is a musical meter notated by the time signature symbol (a C with a line through it), which is the equivalent of . The term is Italian for ""in the style of the breve"".  - An eighth note ( American ) or a quaver ( British ) is a musical note played for half the value of a quarter note ( crotchet ) and twice that of the sixteenth note ( semiquaver ) , which amounts to one quarter the duration of a half note ( minim ) , one eighth the duration of whole note ( semibreve ) , one sixteenth the duration of a double whole note ( breve ) , and one thirty - second the duration of a longa , hence the name . It is the equivalent of the fusa in mensural notation ( Morehen and Rastell 2001 ) Eighth notes are notated with an oval , filled - in note head and a straight note stem with one flag note flag ( see Figure 1 ) . A related symbol is the eighth rest ( or quaver rest ) , which denotes a silence for the same duration . In Unicode , the symbols U +266A (  ) and U +266B (  ) are an eighth note and beamed pair of eighth notes respectively . The two symbols are inherited from the early 1980s code page 437 , where they occupied codes 13 and 14 respectively . Additions to the Unicode standard also incorporated additional eighth note depictions from Japanese emoji sets : ascending eighth notes ( U +1F39C ,  ) , descending eighth noes ( U +1F39D ,  ) , a graphical generic musical note generally depicted as an eighth note ( U +1F3B5 ,  ) , and three unconnected eighth notes in sequence ( U +1F3B6 ,  ) . Unicode 's Musical Symbols block includes several variations of the eighth note ; these are the versions intended to be used in computerized musical notation ( as opposed to the others , which are graphical dingbats ) . As with all notes with stems , the general rule is that eighth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead , facing up , when they are below the middle line of the musical staff . When they are on or above the middle line , they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head , facing down . Alternatively , stems are used to indicate voicing or parts ; all stems for the upper voice 's notes ( or `` parts '' ) are drawn facing up , regardless of their position on the...  - Mensural notation is the musical notation system used for European vocal polyphonic music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term ""mensural"" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like ""musica mensurata"" (""measured music"") or ""cantus mensurabilis"" (""measurable song"") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to ""musica plana"" or ""musica choralis"", i.e., Gregorian plainchant. With mensural notation being employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, plainchant retained its own, older system of neume notation throughout the period, while some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific tablature notation.  - In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head and no note stem. Its length is equal to four beats in time, that is the whole measure (or bar). Most other notes are fractions of the whole note (e.g., half notes and quarter notes are played for one half and one quarter the duration of the whole note, respectively).  - In music, a double whole note (American), breve (international), or double note is a note lasting two times as long as a whole note (or ""semibreve""). In medieval mensural notation, the ""brevis"" (ancestor of the modern breve) was one of the shortest note lengthshence its name, which is the Latin etymon of ""brief"" . In ""perfect"" rhythmic mode, the brevis was a third of a ""longa"", or in ""imperfect"" mode half a ""longa"" (for full details of the complications here, see for example ). However, in modern music notation it is the longest note value still in common use .  - In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet). It was given its Latin name (""minim"", meaning ""least or smallest"") because it was the shortest of the five note values used in early medieval music notation . In time signatures with 4 as the bottom number, such as or time, the half note is two beats long. However, when 2 is the bottom number (including ""alla breve""), the half note is one beat long.  - A quarter note (American) or crotchet (British, from the sense 'hook') is a note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or ""semibreve""). Often, musicians will say that a crotchet is one beat, but this is not always correct, as the beat is indicated by the time signature of the music; a quarter note may or may not be the beat. Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the stave or downwards if it is on or above the middle line. However, the stem direction may differentiate more than one part. The head of the note also reverses its orientation in relation to the stem. (See image.)  - A neume (sometimes spelled neum) is the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation. The word entered the English language in the Middle English forms ""newme"", ""nevme"", ""neme"" in the 15th century, from the Middle French ""neume"", in turn from either medieval Latin ""pneuma"" or ""neuma"", the former either from ancient Greek (""breath"") or (""sign""), or else directly from Greek as a corruption or an adaptation of the former.  - Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In music, a 16th note (American) or semiquaver (British) is a note played for half the duration of an eighth note (quaver), hence the name. It is the equivalent of the semifusa in mensural notation, first found in 15th-century notation .  - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read ""common time"" and ""three-four time"", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the ""color"" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (""mousike""; ""art of the Muses""). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as ""the harmony of the spheres"" and ""it is music to my ears"" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound.""

"Please answer the following question: What is the name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, ""The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically."" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be ""pushed about by the music"", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, ""Veni, Creator Spiritus"", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as ""an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations"". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed ""from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture"".

Plot title: Stalag 17 Movie plot: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the...

"If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a $100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. ""In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,"" Casey said. ""What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?"" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. ""It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,"" West said. ""It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

"Information:  - Strawberry latent ringspot virus ( SLRSV ) is a plant pathogenic virus in an Unassigned family . Its entry in the ICTV database indicates this virus is a Sadwavirus but current literature indicates that it may be a Cheravirus .  - Juice is a beverage made from the extraction or pressing out of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood (e.g., clam juice). Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods allowed for its preservation without using fermentation (the approach used with wine production). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12,840,318 tonnes in 2012. The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The Picornavirales are an order of viruses with vertebrate, insect, and plant hosts. This group consists of viruses which have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes.  - Cheravirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Cherry rasp leaf virus.  - An accessory fruit (sometimes called ""false fruit"", ""spurious fruit"", ""pseudofruit"", or ""pseudocarp"") is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of ""Gaultheria procumbens"" or ""Syzygium jambos"". Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium. Other example could be the ""anthocarps"" specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).  - ""Perfume"" is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents - used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces ""a pleasant scent"".  - Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the order Picornavirales, family Secoviridae, subfamily Comovirinae, genus Cheravirus.  - The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus ""Fragaria"" (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others.  - Secoviridae is a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently 73 species in this family, divided among 11 genera.  - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of ""Theobroma cacao"" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as ""xocoltl"" , a Nahuatl word meaning ""bitter water"". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  - Sadwavirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants (specifically Satsuma mandarin trees) serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species ""Satsuma dwarf virus"". Diseases associated with this genus include: satsuma dwarf virus disease which causes spoon-shaped leaves on citrus tree. Symptoms are enations, multiple flushing, stunting or dwarfing, reduction in number and size of leaves and fruits. The name of this genus comes from its type species: Satsuma dwarf virus.  - Fragaria is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits. There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as ""Fragaria"" × ""ananassa"".

Make BP pay to restore Gulf

Editor's note: David Yarnold is the president of the National Audubon Society.

(CNN) -- BP showed up in court last week, finally, nearly three years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the hell it unleashed on the Gulf Coast. It's a huge, high-stakes trial, and BP is taking the beating it's earned. Here's what's at stake for America if there is a judgment: potentially tens of billions of dollars that will be used to create jobs while restoring some of our most productive and vulnerable natural places.

Whether the trial results in a decision or a settlement, the outcome will send a signal about how serious this country is about enforcing its common-sense rules that guarantee clean air and waters.

BP and its partners have already confessed to criminal negligence in the 2010 blowout that killed 11 men and gushed nearly 5 million barrels of oil. Every part of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, from the deep-sea corals to dolphins to migratory birds, was affected. Gulf Coast residents suffered billions of dollars in economic losses, with effects that rippled across the country.

And despite those slick commercials that assure you all is well and then invite you to spend your tourism dollars on the Gulf Coast, the disaster is still unfolding. Last summer, scientists found traces of BP's oil and dispersant in the eggs of migratory white pelicans nesting all the way up in Minnesota. Oil is still present on the Gulf's beaches, in the marshes and under the water. It is working its way through the food chain, so it will be years before we understand the full extent of the disaster.

BP's billions at stake as courtroom showdown starts

Just Wednesday, in fact, the Gulf Restoration Network documented a fresh rash of tarballs on a Louisiana beach known as Elmer's Island -- a spot that gets re-oiled every time a storm stirs up BP's submerged goo. We're nearly three years in, and there's no end in sight.

That's why our justice system must hold BP and other polluters fully responsible under the law for the worst offshore oil disaster in history. How much could BP end up paying? BP is liable for up to $17.6 billion in penalties under the Clean Water Act if it is found grossly negligent. (And if this isn't gross negligence, it's hard to imagine what is.) Add to that figure the potential for tens of billions more in fines under the Oil Pollution Act.

This much is clear: The rules were put in place to deter and, if needed, to penalize the offenders. The Deepwater Horizon was the kind of disaster that was envisioned when the full force of these penalties was contemplated. Those penalties -- and nothing short -- are the fair outcome.

It wasn't surprising to see BP's stock rise when it agreed to an unprecedented $4.5 billion in criminal fines. The market was saying, in essence: Guys, it could have been a lot worse.

BP claims it now leads the way on safety

So we know that some amount of penalties -- a staggering amount by normal standards -- has already been ""priced in"" to BP's value. So, this isn't about whether BP will continue to be an ATM for shareholders. It will be. And we're not saying that there shouldn't be drilling in the Gulf Coast. We're saying that even megacorporations need to play by the rules.

If Justice Department lawyers agree to a weak settlement, the burden of rebuilding from this disaster will be transferred from a foreign corporation to American taxpayers. Worse, it will send a message to polluters that we don't take seriously our air, water, wildlife, communities or economic health.

What's the difference between a $15 billion settlement and a $35 billion dollar judgment? The ability to rebuild the Louisiana wetlands -- America's delta-- for generations to come. A healthy, productive Gulf Coast where people and wildlife thrive. The principle that if you break it, you buy it.

Families of killed rig workers react to BP settlement

Under the terms of the RESTORE Act -- passed last year with historic bipartisan support -- 80% of Clean Water Act civil penalties will go back to restore the environment and economies of the Gulf Coast states. That's right and fair. We don't love how the states want to spend every dollar. But this is what a grand political bargain looks like, in case we've forgotten.

Two weeks ago, we and our partners hand-delivered more than 133,000 petitions to the Department of Justice, calling for full and complete accountability under the law for BP and its partners. The point of the petitions was pretty straightforward: These rules matter to Americans, and everyone needs to play and -- in this case -- pay fully.

"Riya Sen (born Riya Dev Varma; 24 January 1981) is an Indian film actress and model. Riya, who comes from a family of actors including her grandmother Suchitra Sen, mother Moon Moon Sen and sister Raima Sen, began her acting career in 1991 as a child actress in the film Vishkanya. Her first commercial success in her film career was with Style, a 2001 Hindi low-budget comedy directed by N. Chandra. Some of her other notable films include producer Pritish Nandy's musical film, Jhankaar Beats (2003) in Hinglish,

Riya first appeared as a child artist in the film Vishkanya in 1991, where she played the role of the young Pooja Bedi. At the age of 19, she did National Film Awards winning director Bharathiraja's Tamil film, Taj Mahal (2000), which did not achieve commercial success. She was scheduled to make her Bollywood film debut in Love You Hamesha, opposite actor Akshaye Khanna; however, the film was stalled, and she finally made her debut in N. Chandra's Style in 2001. This low-budget comedy was the first commercial success in over a decade for the director. A launch pad for Riya, cast in the female lead along with fellow-newcomers, Sharman Joshi, Sahil Khan and Shilpi Mudgal, the film pioneered a trend of commercial success for small budget films in India. Riya and the second female lead of the film were replaced by aspirant actresses Sonali Joshi and Jaya Seal in Xcuse Me'.  Her next success was Jhankaar Beats, comedy revolving around the music of legendary composer R D Burman, which saw her playing a small and glamorous role alongside Shayan Munshi, Juhi Chawla, Rahul Bose, Rinke Khanna and Sanjay Suri. Produced by Pritish Nandy, publishing director of The Times of India, the film was made on a budget of Rs. 25 million (US$525,000), marking the sixth in a row of small to medium budget films made by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC). Despite being part of a wave of offbeat films that mostly failed to make an impact at the box office, it drew public attention upon its release, which led to a commercial success among a restricted audience targeted by a selective release in twenty cities. It was one of the first films made in Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English. In 2005, she starred in Shaadi No. 1, which had no female lead. This comedy, based on the theme of modern marriage, was directed by David Dhawan, a renowned film director from this genre.  Although films like Style and Jhankar Beats succeeded commercially, most of her later films have generated less revenue. A number of them remained unfinished. While many of her appearances have been item numbers and cameos, few of her leading roles have been in low-budget films. Though she had small roles in Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), Qayamat (2003) and Plan (2004), attention was drawn to her item numbers in all three, especially the one in Qayamat that featured her in a bubble-bath. Besides this, she performed another item number in James (2005) on director-producer Ram Gopal Varma's behest, who has a history of casting aspirant actress-models like Sameera Reddy, Isha Koppikar and Koena Mitra in similar roles. Furthermore, she took part in a dance number for Sajid Khan's Heyy Babyy (2007) that featured several mainstream Bollywood actresses.

"Abebe Bikila (Amharic: 'ababa biqilaa; August 7, 1932 - October 25, 1973) was an Ethiopian double Olympic marathon champion. He won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot, setting a world record. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Abebe was the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title, breaking his own world record in the process.

Abebe returned to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.  On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu began an unsuccessful coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie's eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting took place in the heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled.  In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot. This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted. The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Kosice. While in Japan, he was approached by a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka Tiger, with the possibility of wearing its shoes; they were informed by Niskanen that Abebe had ""other commitments."" Kihachiro Onitsuka suspected that Abebe had a secret sponsorship deal with Puma, in spite of the now-abandoned rules against such deals.  Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, finishing fifth in 2:24:43, the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. Abebe won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8.

 Image China bridge collapse kills at least five Highway bridge collapses in central China after a truck carrying fireworks explodes, killing at least five people and injuring 11. Sarah Sheffer reports. 
  
 THE collapse of a bridge on an expressway in central China was likely caused by an explosion on a lorry carrying fireworks, a local official has said as state media reports the death toll is 11. 
  
 The accident on Friday sent an 80-metre stretch of viaduct crashing to the ground and left the twisted remains of cars and lorries scattered among the rubble, once again raising questions over the safety of China's infrastructure. 
  
 State television network CCTV today said 11 people had been killed in the accident and four arrested because the lorry was not permitted to carry explosives. 
  
 An official with the Sanmenxia municipality's public security bureau named Zhang said rescuers using equipment to search for any more survivors had not detected any signs of life, warning that the toll could rise further. 
  
 ''There are still vehicles buried in the rubble and we'll need heavy lifting equipment to get them out,'' he said. 
  
 The municipality's deputy propaganda chief Ren Zhanzhou added that initial investigations suggested the lorry carrying firecrackers and fireworks ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays was the likely cause of the disaster. 
  
 Drivers interviewed by CCTV said they saw an explosion before the bridge collapsed, but on popular internet forums, people were sceptical. 
  
 ''Firecrackers and fireworks are not enough to destroy a bridge,'' one user identified as Xinghuhuhu wrote on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 
  
 ''Have some respect for the dead, please! If a poor quality bridge is destroyed by firecrackers going off, it's not a question of a loss of face, some officials have to be fired,'' they added. 
  
 ''There are times when you have to take responsibility.'' 
  
 State-run China National Radio initially said on Friday that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure ''inexplicable''. 
  
 Pictures of the accident showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned lorries with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. 
  
 A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. 
  
 A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. 
  
 The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4400 kilometres from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. 
  
 It stands 30 metres above the ground, media reported. According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. ||||| At least eight killed as China bridge collapses 
  
 (AFP) – Feb 1, 2013 
  
 BEIJING — A bridge on a major expressway in central China collapsed Friday, leaving the twisted remains of cars and trucks scattered among the rubble as state media reported at least eight fatalities. 
  
 There was confusion over the toll, with the official news agency Xinhua saying eight people were dead and 13 injured after a fireworks-laden truck exploded, sending a long section of the viaduct crashing to the ground. 
  
 State-run China National Radio initially said that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure ""inexplicable"". 
  
 State broadcaster CCTV quoted nearby residents as saying they heard a loud booming noise, although it added the cause of the collapse was unclear and it was not known if the truck exploded before or after the bridge collapsed. 
  
 Pictures showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned trucks with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. 
  
 At least five cars could also be seen. CCTV said on its website that at least 25 vehicles were involved. 
  
 A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. 
  
 A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. 
  
 The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4,400 kilometres (2,700 miles) from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. 
  
 It stands 30 metres (yards) above the ground, media reported. 
  
 Many of China's roads are packed as the country gears up for its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns in what is billed as the world's largest annual human migration. 
  
 The season is also a peak period for fireworks producers, as Chinese traditionally buy the explosives to celebrate the festival, which falls on February 10 this year. 
  
 According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. 
  
 China has seen a number of bridge collapses in recent years, which are often blamed on overloading and shoddy construction. One such incident in northeast China last August killed three people.

"I read this background article the other day: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.  I am facing a new situation today: Mark and Jordan want to take a trip together.

"WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to ""end the immigration crisis, once and for all."" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are ""the weakest in the history of the world."" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called ""Angel Families,"" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. ""Your loss will not have been in vain,"" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. ""We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country."" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented ""zero tolerence"" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. According to the above context, answer the following question. What did President Trump think of the compliments from the Angel Families?

Plot title: Crack in the World Movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth. My question: What is Dr. Sorensen dying of?

"Given the question: This article: Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 ""It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds"".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

As a child he began training in Kabuki in a theatre troupe run by Kataoka Nizaemon XI, and appeared in one film in 1923. He eventually entered the movie world for good in 1927 first at Makino Productions, but following the lead of other former Makino stars like Tsumasabur Band, Chiez started his own independent production company, Chiez Productions, the next year.

Born in Tokyo as the son of a shinpa actor, Inagaki appeared on stage in his childhood before joining the Nikkatsu studio as an actor in 1922. Wishing to become a director, he joined Chiez Kataoka's Chiez Productions and made his directorial debut in 1928 with ""Tenka taiheiki"". Returning to Nikkatsu, he continued making jidaigeki and participated in the Naritaki Group of young filmmakers such as Sadao Yamanaka and Fuji Yahiro who collaboratively wrote screenplays under the made up name ""Kinpachi Kajiwara"". Like others in the group, Inagaki was known for his cheerful and intelligent samurai films. Inagaki later moved to Daiei and then Toho, where he made big budget color spectacles as well as delicate works depicting the feelings of children.

Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (; German: ['gotlo:p 'fre:g@]; 8 November 1848 - 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.

Frege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840-1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence.  His other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806-86; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of planes, analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer (1824-1900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other electronic machines); and the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824-1907; Kantian and critical philosophy).  Starting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Gottingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch (1833-72; analytical geometry), Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824-97; function theory), Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804-91; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845-1915; theory of electricity), and Hermann Lotze (1817-81; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures.  In 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of ""Ueber eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginaren Gebilde in der Ebene"" (""On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane""), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points.  Frege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 - 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.Answer this question using a quote from the following article:

"Background: Macaulay Carson Culkin was born in New York City. His father, Christopher Cornelius ""Kit"" Culkin, is a former actor known for his productions on Broadway and is the brother of actress Bonnie Bedelia. His mother is Patricia Brentrup, who never married Culkin. He was named Macaulay after Thomas Babington Macaulay and Carson after Kit Carson of the Old West.
Context: In the spring of 2003, he made a guest appearance on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. His role as Karen Walker's deceptively immature divorce lawyer won him favorable reviews. Culkin headed back into motion pictures in 2003 with Party Monster, in which he played a role very different from those he was known for; that of party promoter Michael Alig, a drug user and murderer. He quickly followed that with a supporting part in Saved!, as a cynical wheelchair-using, non-Christian student in a conservative Christian high school. Though Saved! only had modest success at the box office, Culkin received positive reviews for his role in the film and its implications for a career as an adult actor. In 2004, he appeared in the music video for the song ""Sunday"" by the rock band Sonic Youth. Culkin began doing voice-over work, with appearances in Seth Green's Robot Chicken.  In 2006, he published an experimental, semi-autobiographical novel, Junior, which featured details about Culkin's stardom and his shaky relationship with his father.  Culkin starred in Sex and Breakfast, a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. Alexis Dziena, Kuno Becker and Eliza Dushku also star in this story of a couple whose therapist recommends they engage in group sex. Shooting for the film, Culkin's first since Saved!, took place in September 2006. The film opened in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007 and was released on DVD on January 22, 2008 by First Look Pictures. Culkin's next project was a role in the thirteen-episode NBC television series Kings as Andrew Cross.  In 2009, Culkin appeared in a UK-based commercial for Aviva Insurance (formerly Norwich Union) to help promote their company's rebranding. Culkin stared into the camera stating, ""Remember me."" On August 17, 2009, Culkin made a brief cameo appearance on WWE Raw at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri, following a ""falls count anywhere"" match between Hornswoggle and Chavo Guerrero, in which Guerrero was defeated by the classic Home Alone gag of rigging a swinging paint can to hit him upon opening a door. Culkin appeared in the doorway and said, ""That's not funny."" In February 2010, Culkin appeared in an episode of Poppy de Villeneuve's online series for The New York Times, The Park. On March 7 of the same year, he appeared alongside actors Matthew Broderick, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and Jon Cryer in a tribute to the late John Hughes.

She carries a single ski boot and describes eXistenZ, which is a new game system (metaflesh). Almost everyone in the room volunteers to test the new system. At the door, a game company worker Ted (Jude Law) screens Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) for recording devices. Noel has an outdated gamepod, and is anxious about the demo.The demo uses flesh like gamepods to allows players to interact with the game. As they go into a trance to enter the game, Noel pulls an odd-looking gun out from inside his gamepod and shoots Allegra in the shoulder. The gamers attached to her feel the impact, and Noel gets shot by security. Ted grabs the gun and whisks Allegra away. In the car, Allegra throws Ted's phone away, as it can be used to track them. He uses a pocketknife to dig out the bullet, which is a tooth. They realize the gun and ammo are made of flesh and bone, which would not be detected by a scanner.They stop at a motel. Ted wants to check in with Antenna, but Allegra wants to test the game, and needs Ted to help her. Ted does not have a ""bio-port"". They go to a gas station and ask the attendant Gas (Willem Dafoe) to install an illegal port. He agrees, after recognizing Allegra. When she connects her pod to Ted, it short circuits, locking everyone out of the game. Gas reappears, holding a shotgun, and explains that Ted's port is useless. Ted shoots Gas in the neck before he can kill Allegra.Allegra and Ted drive to an old ski club, where they find Kiri Vinokur (Iam Holm). She hands the ski boot to Kiri for safekeeping, then Kiri and Landry (James Kirchner) work to repair the pod. Afterwards, Allegra and Ted jack into the game, and Ted's reality changes. Allegra says ""you have to play the game, to find out WHY you're playing the game. They meet a gameshop owner, D'Arcy Nader (Robert A. Silverman), and Ted realizes the non-player characters (NPCs) must act based on his actions and speech. Nader gives them...

When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator.

"G.O.P.âs Hopes to Take Senate Are Dimming
Then the government shut down. Now, instead of sharpening their attacks on Democrats, Republicans on Capitol Hill are being forced to explain why they are not to blame and why Americans should trust them to govern both houses of Congress when the one they do run is in such disarray. Complicating the prospects, the grass-roots political force that has provided so much of the energy for conservative victories over the last four years â the Tea Party â is aggressively working against Republicans it considers not conservative enough.

As a result, many Republicans are openly worrying that the fallout from the fiscal battles paralyzing the capital will hit hardest not in the House, which seems safely in Republican hands thanks to carefully redrawn districts, but in the Senate. Republican infighting, they say, has given Democrats the cover they need to deflect blame and keep their majority.

âThe Tea Party benefits when the energy is focused on the Democratic Party and their agenda,â said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and former strategist for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. âWhatâs concerning is a select few groups trying to turn that fire inward on the Republican Party. And that is not helpful.â

In states like Georgia, Louisiana and Montana, the members of the House who are now running for the Senate are demanding that Mr. Obama make concessions on the health care law in exchange for reopening the government. That might help in a Republican primary, but it puts the candidates at risk of damaging their viability in the general election.

And in other states like Kentucky, where the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, is fighting off a primary challenge from the Tea Party right and would face a strong Democratic opponent, being associated with Republicans in Washington is as freighted as it has ever been. Mr. McConnellâs newest advertisement, in fact, adopts the grievances as his own. âAngry with Washington? So am I,â says Mr. McConnell, a 28-year veteran of the Senate.

Many Republicans fear that if Mr. McConnellâs opponent wins the nomination, the seat will flip to the Democrats.

With the elections still a year away, it is impossible to tell what other factors might alter the field. But Republicans, Democrats and independent experts all agree that the government shutdown has added one more cross for Republicans to bear.

âIf I were running for the U.S. Senate, would I want to be running from Washington? No,â said Charlie Cook, the editor of The Cook Political Report, which tracks Congressional races. âAnd if I were running from Washington, would I want to be running from the House Republican side? No.â

The Republicans have little margin of error. A new analysis by Cook Political showed how difficult the math was. The party would need to win five of the six Senate seats considered most competitive to recapture a majority. All six of those seats are in states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, but as Mr. Cook put it, âThe path is very, very, very narrow.â

Nowhere are Republican candidates more saddled with baggage from their day jobs in the House than in Georgia, where three members are among those vying for the Senate nomination. Two of the candidates, Representatives Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun, have among the most conservative voting records in the House, and the third, Representative Jack Kingston, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, has a reputation for being far less ideological.

In an interview last week, Mr. Kingston objected to his opponentsâ premise that the primary fight was forcing him to be more rigid about the shutdown than he ordinarily would be. He said he was not even remotely centrist.

âWait a minute, wait a minute,â he said with a wide grin on his face as he checked off the conservative organizations that had given him high marks. âOne hundred percent National Right to Life. A-plus N.R.A. Ninety-five percent lifetime with the American Conservative Union. And Iâm the moderate?â

He said he would side with his more conservative colleagues to defund the health care law or shut the government even if he were not running for the Senate. âTo the degree that going through short-term sacrifice to change the long-term spending pattern of America, it seems to be the only way to get things done in this environment,â he said.

A fourth Senate candidate, Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, is trying to use her distance from Washington Republicans as an advantage. In a new ad, she notes that her three opponents have a combined four decades in Washington. âTheir experience is expensive, and the truth is they are the problem,â she says.

In Louisiana and Montana, which have a history of electing moderate Democrats to the Senate, the likely Republican nominees are House members who have aligned themselves with the conservatives who are vowing to keep the government closed until Mr. Obama agrees to changes in the health care law.

In Montana, Democrats have piled on Representative Steve Daines, a first-term congressman who is expected to run for the seat being vacated by Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat who was first elected in 1978. They have sought to portray Mr. Daines, who signed on to the effort not to vote for a budget until the health care law is stripped of its financing, as a pawn of Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who has led the defunding campaign on Capitol Hill.

The Republican candidate in Louisiana, Representative Bill Cassidy, is a three-term veteran who despite having a 92 percent rating from the American Conservative Union has been attacked by some on the right for supporting health care reform as a state legislator. He has also signed on to the Cruz effort.

The candidate who seems less likely at this point to be tainted by his association with House Republicans, members of both parties agree, is Representative Tom Cotton, an Arkansas freshman who is challenging Senator Mark Pryor, a two-term Democrat. Mr. Cotton, 36, a former Army Ranger and Harvard Law School graduate, is a distinctive enough candidate that his association with House Republicans, strategists say, could be overshadowed by the more compelling aspects of his biography.

For their part, the incumbent Democrats who will face off against the Republicans who have embraced the shutdown strategy seem to feel that they have caught a lucky break.

When told the other day that Republicans were hopeful they could topple her by attacking her insistence that Democrats not give in on the health law or the debt ceiling, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was incredulous.

âOh, really?â she said. âOh, really?â

"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

"Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

"Thursday night's event, run by the country's Truth and Dignity Commission, aims to ease tensions arising from past abuses.
More than 62,000 incidents, including torture and rape, have been filed to the commission since 2013.
Tunisia became a democracy after President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011.
The commission is investigating reports of police torture, corruption and murder over a 50-year-period since independence.
Alleged abusers include Tunisia's previous state authorities and top security bosses.
A quarter of alleged victims are women who have complained about sexual violence, formerly a taboo in Tunisia.
The mother of a protester shot by security forces in 2011, Ourida Kadoussi, began the televised testimonies.
""They killed our children. We have not been given our rights,"" she said asking for freedom and dignity.
The president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, Sihem Ben Sedrine, opened the forum saying: ""Tunisia will not accept human rights abuses after today. This is the message from Tunisia.""
London-based human rights charity Amnesty International has welcomed the hearings, saying victims ""may finally have a chance to have their right to truth fulfilled"".
But the charity also said it is uncertain whether justice will be done.
""The real test facing Tunisia's transitional justice process, however, is whether it will ultimately lead to criminal prosecutions for the crimes of the past decades.""
Tunisians seek justice for past wrongs
The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tunis says victims of abuse have each been given up to one hour to tell their stories to a panel of commissioners, and an audience including representatives of civic groups and international observers.
The commission hopes that victims will forgive their alleged abusers. But many victims who have spoken to the BBC have demanded financial compensation and say the accused should be held accountable in court.
The Truth and Dignity Commission says alleged abusers might also have a chance to give public testimonies in the near future. Two additional TV hearings are scheduled in December and January.
Tunisia's uprising was the first of the 2011 Arab Spring, and often hailed as the most successful with the country now functioning as a parliamentary democracy. But across the country many struggle to find work amid a high unemployment rate.
According to Reuters, the commission has said the hearings could boost economic investment ""because foreign investors will know that Tunisia is dismantling its authoritarian and corrupt system"".
The country is due to host an investment conference at the end of November.

Most of Bobby's free time is spent hanging out at a local diner during his lunch and dinner breaks to see his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black), who has dreams of singing country music. On weekends, Bobby hangs out in the company of Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and has sex with other women. Bobby has evidently not told anyone that he is a former classical pianist who comes from an eccentric family of musicians.When Rayette becomes pregnant and his friend Elton is arrested and sent to jail for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, Bobby quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his older sister, Partita (Lois Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita informs him that their father, from whom he is estranged, has suffered two strokes and is now an invalid. She urges him to return to the family home in Washington State.As Rayette has threatened to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, he very reluctantly asks her along to his home town. Driving north, they pick up two women headed for Alaska, one of whom is obsessed about ""filth."" The four of them are thrown out of a restaurant when he gets into an argument with a waitress who refuses to accommodate his special order of a chicken salad. After dropping off the two women (who are implied to be a lesbian couple), Bobby and Rayette check into a roadside motel for the night.The next day, nearing his destination, Bobby, clearly embarrassed by the Southern trailer-trash Rayette's lack of polish and crude manners, tells her to remain at the motel before proceeding to his family home on an island in Puget Sound.Upon arrival at his family's country house, Bobby finds Partita giving their father a haircut, but the old man seems completely oblivious to him.

"Frenzal Rhomb is an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992, with Jason Whalley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this entire period. In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999),

Frenzal Rhomb formed in 1992 in the Sydney suburb of Newtown with Alexis 'Lex' Feltham on bass guitar and Jason Whalley on vocals. Feltham and Whalley had been school mates at St Ives High School in St Ives. Whalley had commenced a Bachelor of Arts course in philosophy at Sydney University when he formed Frenzal Rhomb as a punk rock band. The band was formed to take part in a battle of the bands and at that stage was not seen as a permanent project.The name is a reference to a band member's pet rat, which in turn was named for the Fresnel rhomb, which is a prism-like device invented by the 19th Century French engineer, Augustin-Jean Fresnel. By 1993, the group's line-up was Feltham, Whalley, Ben Costello on guitar and Karl Perske on drums. They played at the Sydney venue for the Big Day Out in January.  In March 1994, the band issued a seven-track EP, Dick Sandwich. Its cover had ""a graphic drawing of the offending flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce."" Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature and told them to ""grow up"". The EP was described as having ""good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona"" and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, ""I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson"" (aka ""Roger""), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson - a Seven News anchor on TV - who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites ""Chemotherapy"", and a cover of the TV series theme ""Home And Away"". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, ""Sorry About the Ruse"", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182.  In March 1995, Frenzal Rhomb released their first studio album, Coughing Up a Storm, on Shock Records' sub-label Shagpile Records. Perske was replaced by Nat Nykyruj on drums before the album appeared. The album features live fan favourite ""Genius"". In October 1997, it was retitled Once a Jolly Swagman Always a Jolly Swagman and issued with additional tracks by the US label Liberation Records. In mid-1995, the group supported NOFX on their national tour. Fat Mike, a member of NOFX, was also the owner of Fat Wreck Chords, and he signed the band to his label, which released the 4 Litres EP in the US.

"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: neurons talk each other through Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Long backstory ahead.

My friend and I are both 3rd year highschoolers, everyday our school has a special classes for general work and activities, and that includes class competitions that we're both apart of. What the competition entails is bringing in the most food for your classroom and whichever has the most wins a special breakfast for the class. After all is decided, all the food the school donates is then given to charities.

My class is one of the two most competitive classes for this, and last year we just barely lost. The most common way to get food is to stand outside grocery stores and request them to buy the needed food. Last year my friend convinced me to do a total of four shifts, I hated it as we were standing in the cold at night for two hours, good cause but it was tiring. 

My friend texted me asking where I was as he was just about ready to do the second, and I had no clue about it due to lack of communication. When I explained that I couldn't come as it was in the opposite direction from another friend's house I was at and too short of notice, he simply said 'Fuck you' and held that grudge for awhile after, ignoring me (The grudge lasted through the rest of the hours he would do until we cleared it up, understanding it was a genuine miscommunication on both parts).

Now to the point, he's been egging me on to do the service with him to get food donations for awhile this year. I haven't said it directly but I have shown I'm not eager to. I'm not in opposition to charity work in the slightest, but it was very draining and cold especially this time of year. And additionally I felt that he was being harsh last year instead of wanting to communicate with me when I was trying to and I'm afraid of it breaking out into drama with him again.

He said today that if I don't do the work with him, I need to bring in my own groceries to donate or he won't hang out outside of school with me. I can assume this means the silent treatment at school as well for at least a few weeks. I feel the need to state how this charity work shouldn't be used as a punishment against me, but for his own good intentions. I'm thinking of bringing my own groceries to donate, but if I do I want to make it clear that I didn't do it to remain his friend but actually take part in the charity work, not even for some stupid breakfast.

So AITA? Am I in the right to not want to do hours with him, and stating how I don't want to contribute out of his threats to our friendship? 

Or should I just do the hours with him? Am I making too big of a deal out of what happened close to a year ago?

"Please answer the following question: Hong Kong (CNN)--A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device he hopes will suck pollutants from Beijing's smog-covered skies, creating columns of clean air for residents. An electromagnetic   field caused by copper coils   will pull small pieces in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. ""It's like when you have a balloon which has electricity and your hair goes toward it.Same with the smog,"" says artist Daan Roosegaarde.His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks.With its skies regularly covered by filthy gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to deal with the problem in public. Roosegaarde says an indoor experiment has already proved it works and he is confident the results--with the help of a team of scientists and engineers--can be copied outside.""Beijing is quite good because the smog is quite low. It's in a valley so there's not so much wind.It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get rid of the smog so you can see the sun again."" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a complete solution to Beijing's serious and terrible air pollution.""This is not the real answer for smog.The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles,"" he says. However, he hopes the project will make a difference by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.""I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,"" he says.He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used. Roosegaarde's studio has worked on several projects that use static electricity  in unusual ways:creating a road that charges electric cars and a floor that generates electricity when danced on. Why is the project carried out in Beijing? A) Because Beijing is the most polluted city. B) Because the designer lives in Beijing. C) Because there is much wind in Beijing. D) Because the environment suits the project.

 Other best-drama nominees were the psychosexual dance thriller ""Black Swan,"" the boxing saga ""The Fighter,"" the sci-fi blockbuster ""Inception"" and the Facebook chronicle ""The Social Network."" 
  
 Nominees in the Globes' other best-picture category, for musical or comedy, are the Lewis Carroll fantasy ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the song-and-dance extravaganza ""Burlesque,"" the lesbian-family tale ""The Kids Are All Right,"" the action tale ""Red"" and the romantic thriller ""The Tourist."" 
  
 ""The Social Network"" and ""The Fighter"" tied for second with six nominations each. Among nominations for ""The Social Network"" were Jesse Eisenberg as best dramatic actor, Andrew Garfield as supporting actor and David Fincher as director. 
  
 ""The Fighter"" earned four acting nominations, best actor for Mark Wahlberg and supporting honors for Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. Its nominations also included a directing slot for David O. Russell. 
  
 Johnny Depp earned two nominations, as best musical or comedy actor for ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Tourist."" 
  
 Along with Eisenberg, Firth and Wahlberg, best dramatic actor contenders are James Franco for the survival story ""127 Hours"" and Ryan Gosling for the marital tale ""Blue Valentine."" 
  
 Nominees for best dramatic actress are Halle Berry for the multiple-personality drama ""Frankie and Alice,"" Nicole Kidman for the grieving-parent tale ""Rabbit Hole,"" Jennifer Lawrence for the Ozarks crime yarn ""Winter's Bone,"" Natalie Portman for ""Black Swan"" and Michelle Williams for ""Blue Valentine."" 
  
 Along with Fincher and Russell, directing nominees are Darren Aronofsky for ""Black Swan,"" Tom Hooper for ""The King's Speech"" and Christopher Nolan for ""Inception."" 
  
 Nolan's sci-fi hit also earned nominations for screenplay and musical score, but its cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, was snubbed for acting slots. 
  
 Joel and Ethan Coen's Western ""True Grit,"" starring Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, was shut out completely. 
  
 Joining Depp in the musical or comedy actor race are Paul Giamatti in the curmudgeon chronicle ""Barney's Version,"" Jake Gyllenhaal in the romance ""Love and Other Drugs"" and Kevin Spacey in the Jack Abramoff saga ""Casino Jack."" 
  
 Depp's ""The Tourist"" co-star Angelina Jolie is among musical or comedy actress nominees. Also competing are Annette Bening and Julianne Moore as a lesbian couple in ""The Kids Are All Right,"" Anne Hathaway in ""Love and Other Drugs"" and Emma Stone in the high school romp ""Easy A."" 
  
 Hollywood's second-highest film honors, the Globes traditionally were a solid weather vane for predicting which film might triumph at the Academy Awards. But the Globes have provided murky forecasts in recent times. In the last six years, only a single recipient of one of the Globe best-film prizes has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars _ 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" 
  
 That came after a stretch of eight-straight years when a Globe winner in either the dramatic or musical-comedy category went on to claim the best-picture Oscar. 
  
 Like the Globes, the Oscars will feature 10 best-picture nominees, but in a single category, after academy overseers doubled the number of contenders so a broader range of films could compete. 
  
 With two acclaimed dramas _ ""The King's Speech"" and ""The Social Network"" _ considered front-runners this time, there are prospects of another divergent year between the Globes and the Oscars, whose nominations come out Jan. 25, nine days after the Globes are presented. 
  
 ""The Social Network"" already has snagged two key prizes as both Los Angeles and New York film critics groups picked it as the year's best movie. The National Board of Review, a group of film historians, educators and students, also picked ""The Social Network"" as best of the year. 
  
 The Globes and Oscars typically line up better on acting winners. Last year, ""Avatar"" won best drama at the Globes and ""The Hurt Locker"" took best picture at the Oscars. But all four Oscar acting recipients _ Sandra Bullock for ""The Blind Side,"" Jeff Bridges for ""Crazy Heart,"" Mo'Nique for ""Precious"" and Christoph Waltz for ""Inglourious Basterds"" _ also won prizes at the Globes first. 
  
 Clear favorites have emerged this season for best actor (Firth in ""The King's Speech"") and supporting actor (Bale in ""The Fighter""). 
  
 Bening for ""The Kids Are All Right"" and Portman for ""Black Swan"" could wind up in a two-woman race for best actress at the Oscars, while the supporting-actress category is up for grabs among prospects that include Adams and Leo for ""The Fighter,"" Bonham Carter for ""The King's Speech"" and 14-year-old newcomer Hailee Steinfeld for ""True Grit."" 
  
 No matter how the two awards shows line up on winners, the stars generally can count on a good time at the Globes, a more laid-back, dinner-and-drinks affair than the stately Oscars. 
  
 The Globes are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 85 critics and reporters for overseas outlets. 
  
 Robert De Niro, an eight-time Globe nominee who won a best-actor prize there for ""Raging Bull,"" will receive the group's Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. 
  
 Ricky Gervais is returning as host of the Globes ceremony, which will air live Jan. 16 on NBC.

So the problem is exactly as it's above. My friend thought it was a good idea to post a picture of him and his friend H (who is incidentally my girlfriend, but I know he has no ill intentions) with a cheesy romantic caption (a joke, according to him), on the day of his 2 year anniversary with his girlfriend, M. According to him, M had agreed to the picture being posted, but I'm assuming he said nothing about the caption he would use, or the picture just being H and him awkwardly staring at each other, a picture that would definitely look wrong to a fourth person not in our friends group. Now he wonders why M won't talk properly to him, and believes she's being childish. So does my girlfriend H.
 
But I side with M. It was 1 out of 365 days of the year, and supposed to be their special day.

"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I thought I might get some good ideas if I went down to the hospital. I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were ""guests""; their families were ""guests"" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

"This figure could rise further as police continue their investigation, Assistant Chief Constable of Sussex Police Steve Barry added.
The vintage jet plummeted into traffic on the A27 on Saturday after attempting a loop manoeuvre.
Some victims of the accident have been named by their families.
The number of deaths was initially given as seven, but ACC Barry said it was now ""highly likely"" that 11 had died.
Victims who have been named by their families include Matt Jones, 24, and Worthing United FC footballer Matthew Grimstone, 23.
Another Worthing United footballer, Jacob Schilt, 23, is also believed to be among the victims, his club said.
In a statement, Worthing United FC said Mr Grimstone was their first team goalkeeper and was quiet and reserved, but with a ""huge talent and a brilliant player with huge potential"".
Mr Schilt was a ""tenacious midfielder, a skilful player, with an eye for goal"", the club said.
Sussex Police has said no-one on the airfield was injured but that the pilot - named locally as former RAF pilot Andy Hill - remained in a critical condition in hospital. He was pulled from the burning wreckage.
The status of the jet's ejector seats was yet to be determined, ACC Barry said.
He said the removal of victims' bodies was likely to continue throughout Monday. It was ""quite possible"" more victims would be discovered, he added.
ACC Barry said a crane would be brought in to lift the wreckage of the aircraft on Monday.
The large crash site remains a hazardous area, with fuel still on the plane.
In a video released by Sussex Police, ACC Barry later described the crash as ""devastating"".
He said: ""I've certainly not seen anything like this in my career in terms of the scale, the tragedy and the impact that this is going to have on the local community.
""We are entering the recovery phase of the operation and as we do that we are likely to uncover more fatalities but we are putting in a huge amount of effort in supporting the families and helping them to understand what has happened.""
He appealed to drivers to avoid the area, saying the A27, which was badly damaged during the crash, would be closed for at least another two days.
The crash happened at 13:20 BST on Saturday as the Hawker Hunter jet came out of a loop manoeuvre.
It then smashed into the A27, sending a fireball across the carriageway.
Neil McCarthy, a friend of pilot Andy Hill, told the BBC News Channel that the loop manoeuvre was regarded as ""one of the most dangerous"" to attempt.
He said that ""if you don't have the right entry speed, the right pull back on the stick, the G-force, the right gate height at the top of the loop manoeuvre, it can go wrong pretty quick"".
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is also continuing to investigate the scene alongside the police, who have urged people to think twice before posting ""extremely graphic"" images of the crash online.

"Here is a news article: The worst grasshopper infestation in 20 years has become so thick around Albuquerque, N.M., that the airborne bugs are showing up on weather radar, officials said today. 
  
 ""Albuquerque has not seen these levels of grasshoppers since the early-mid 1990's,"" said John R. Garlisch, extension agent at Bernalillo County Cooperative Extension Service. 
  
 The National Weather Service said the air is so dense with the bugs that they appear on its radar like rain. 
  
 Grasshopper infestation is so dense around Albuquerque, N.M., they show up on weather radar like rain. National Weather Service 
  
 ""We have actually been noticing the insects on radar since about Memorial Day,"" said NWS spokesman David Craft. ""We have noticed the greatest impact on the radar during the evening, but they are noticeable at other times of the day, too."" 
  
 ""It is a nuisance to people because they fly into people's faces while walking, running, and biking. They are hopping into people's homes and garages, they splatter the windshield and car grill while driving, and they will eat people's plants,"" Garlisch said. 
  
 The swarm, the worst in two decades, is being blamed on the drought. 
  
 ""There wasn't enough winter to kill the egg pots. Because of the dry winter the eggs survived, hence the outbreak of grasshoppers,"" David B. Richman, professor emeritus at the Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, and Weed Science, New Mexico State University said. 
  
 Garlisch also said that the lack of forage and food on the open range lands is pushing the grasshoppers to seek greener pastures. ""What better place than the Rio Grande with its riparian vegetation and an urban center where people keep green lush yards and gardens?"" he said. 
  
 Bernalillo County Cooperative Extension Service told ABC News that they received many complaints about the grasshoppers. 
  
 ""Some people are freaked out about them, others fear they will bring disease, and some folks want different agencies to spray to control them,"" said Garlisch. 
  
 While some people expect the state or the county to spray the grasshoppers, others protest any public spraying. 
  
 ""Reality, spraying insecticide will be ineffective and will cause more harm than good,"" he said. 
  
 Katie Goetz, spokeswoman of the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, said that the department is aware of people's complaints. ""The department determined that this is a homeowners' issue rather than an agricultural… It's localized in Bernalillo County,"" Goetz said. 
  
 The damage the grasshoppers may do includes eating the young tender leaves of flowers and vegetables. ""We are encouraging gardeners to cover plants. Insecticide sprays are ineffective and not recommended. Grasshoppers are flying upwards of 3-5 miles. If an insecticide for the home gardener is used, it may kill a few grasshoppers, but more will be flying in. The more the homeowner sprays, this will negatively impact other insect species as well as the plant growth,"" said Garlisch. 
  
 Garlisch recommended waiting for this cycle to end. ""Wait it out…As with everything this too shall pass,"" he said. |||||  
  
 ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) – It started out as a mystery that even the National Weather Service couldn’t solve. 
  
 Their Doppler radar has been showing something moving over the Metro area each night. 
  
 Now they know that huge mass is a swarm of grasshoppers flying over Albuquerque. 
  
 “In this situation, we know that it’s something other than precipitation because the particles we’re sensing are not uniform – they’re busier,” said Brent Wachter, forecaster with NWS in Albuquerque. 
  
 Wachter says he’s occasionally seen activity from bats in the Jemez or cicadas, during particularly bad seasons but never a grasshopper swarm covering the entire Metro. 
  
 “We actually thought the radar was broke, so we had our technicians go out there a couple times,” he said. “They couldn’t find anything wrong, so we had to call the National Radar Depot in Oklahoma.” 
  
 The people in Oklahoma said they’d seen something like it before and asked whether Albuquerque was having any sort of insect infestation. 
  
 The radar shows that swarm of grasshoppers is flying about 1,000 feet in the air. 
  
 For perspective, that’s about three times the height of the Bank of Albuquerque. 
  
 “We can explain it, certainly,” said Paul Smith, with the city of Albuquerque Environmental Department. 
  
 Smith says the grasshoppers seen in Albuquerque’s invasion are pretty good flyers to start with, and then, there’s the wind. 
  
 “With temperatures warming up, we have a lot of thermal inversions,” he said. “It’s no stretch to imagine that they’re getting pulled up by some of these up currents and getting high into the atmosphere.” 
  
 Smith says last year’s big monsoon season, plus the mild winter, created the perfect combination for all the grasshoppers just waiting to hatch a few weeks ago. 
  
 He says they should die off in mid-June.

"By. Louise Eccles. PUBLISHED:. 07:47 EST, 18 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 08:57 EST, 18 September 2013. Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6. The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. Indication: The two women accused of drug smuggling might enter guilty pleas to secure transfers to UK jails. But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story. They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing. Now, Peruvian counter narcotics prosecutor Luis Mendoza has said the women could apply to serve their sentences in Britain. He said: 'It's very possible that they may complete their sentence in the United Kingdom.' Miss Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.' But a legal source close to the case told the Mail a transfer could take many years, by which time they could be free. Write caption here. The women are expected to serve. two-and-a-half years of a six-year-and-eight-month sentence, after which. time they can apply to serve their parole in Britain anyway. The source said: 'The process is very slow. 'There. are two British men in jail for drug smuggling in Peru right now, who. have been trying for several years to be transferred back home to. complete their sentence there. 'It. is a very long process and Britain does not often agree to it. It is. not in their interest to. Why would they want them in their prisons?' A. 2008 Peruvian law gives foreigners the option to serve sentences back. home, and Britain has a prisoner transfer agreement with Lima. Miss Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly, from Northern Ireland, will need to show they behaved well in jail, pass 'legal, social, medical and psychological tests' and can fund their own tickets back. They are currently being held in the tough Virgen de Fatima prison, on the outskirts of Lima. Charities warn of dire conditions and claim poorer inmates are forced to prostitute themselves in return for food. However, Miss Reid has compared it to a 'Brownie camp', and said she spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions. Hope: William Reid, father of Melissa, believes he can start the ball rolling to get his daughter moved to Glasgow. Pictured here on Daybreak earlier this month.

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A Lesson in Love ( Swedish : En lektion i kärlek ) is a 1954 Swedish comedy film directed by Ingmar Bergman . The film is about the marriage of a gynecologist named David and his wife Marianne . The film 's score was composed by Dag Wirén .  - Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918  30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957), ""Wild Strawberries"" (1957), ""Persona"" (1966), ""Cries and Whispers"" (1972) and ""Fanny and Alexander"" (1982).  - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play ""Wood Painting"". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words ""And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour"". Here the motif of silence refers to the ""silence of God,"" which is a major theme of the film.  - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history.  - Cries and Whispers (lit. ""Whispers and Cries"") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film is set at a mansion at the end of the 19th century and is about two sisters and a maid who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. After several unsuccessful experimental films, ""Cries and Whispers"" was a critical and commercial success. It received nominations for five Academy Awards. These included a nomination for Best Picture, which was unusual for a foreign-language film.    What is the relationship between 'a lesson in love' and 'drama film'?

A White House statement said Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Kim Tuesday morning, with only translators present, followed by a working lunch and an expanded bilateral meeting that will include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and National Security Advisor John Bolton. The U.S. president will then address the media before flying out late Tuesday Singapore time. Previous reports had suggested Trump would leave on Wednesday.

There will not be a repeat of “flimsy agreements” made between previous U.S. administrations and North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Singapore on Monday. “The ultimate objective we seek from diplomacy with North Korea has not changed — the complete, verifiable and irreversible de-nuclearization of the Korea peninsula is only outcome that the United States will accept,” declared Pompeo. Sanctions will remain until North Korea completely and verifiably eliminates its weapons of mass destruction programs, added Pompeo. “If diplomacy does not move in the right direction, those measures will increase,” he said. Pompeo said he is “very optimistic” the meeting Tuesday between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “will have a successful outcome.” “It’s the case in each of those two countries there are only two people that can make decisions of this magnitude and those two people are going to be sitting in the room together tomorrow,” said Pompeo.

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 17:37 EST, 6 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 17:49 EST, 6 January 2014. A man who gained nationwide celebrity status on social media as 'Kai the hatchet-weilding hitchiker' today pleaded not guilty to a charge of killing a 73-year-old lawyer in the victim's New Jersey home in May. Caleb McGillivary, 24 - who shot to online infamy in February after a TV interview went viral - stood silent during his arraignment before Superior Court Judge Joseph Donohue. McGillivary's attorney, Union County Public Defender Peter Liguori, filed the not guilty plea to the charge of murder in the beating death of Joseph Galfy, according to Nj.com. Liguori said he could not comment on the case, but acknowledged that McGillivary is feeling better than he did shortly after his arrest. Caleb McGillvary, better known as 'Kai the hatchet-wielding hitchiker' thanks to some internet fame, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. He is pictured here in a Facebook photo from July, which helped police arrest him thanks to his distinctive facial tattoo. Hospitalized: Caleb McGillvary, known as Kai, is. pictured here following his arrest in May. He was rushed to a hospital in. August with self-inflicted wounds following a suicide attempt. He has pleaded not guilty to murder. A YouTube video in February made Caleb McGillivary an internet star following a hitchiking incident in California. He had been picked up by a man who 'believed he was Jesus' and hit a gas station worker with his car. McGillvary subdued the man with the back of a hatchet. Victim: Lawyer Joseph Galfy Jr, 72, was found beaten to death at his New Jersey home in May. Police allege Caleb McGillvary killed him after a 24 hour rendezvous. 'He's doing better than he was a couple of months ago,' Liguori said. In July, McGillivary was rushed from the Union County jail in Elizabeth to a hospital for treatment of self-inflicted wounds following an apparent suicide attempt. He was later returned to the jail. McGillivary is suspected of beating Galfy, a partner in a Rahway law firm, in Galfy's home on May 12, about 24 hours after the two met in Manhattan's Times Square, authorities have said, following a sexual tryst. In custody: Mugshot of Caleb 'Kai the Hitchhiker' McGillvary, 25, taken after his arrest in Philadelphia. McGillivary is said to have gone to Galfy's home and stayed the night. The next day Galfy, the attorney for the Green Brook land use board, drove McGillvary to the Rahway Train station, from where the younger man left for Asbury Park. McGillvary returned to Rahway later in the day. After exchanging text messages, Galfy picked him up and brought him back to his house. Police allege the killing happened sometime that evening. The next day, Monday May 13, police went to Galfy's home after he did not show up for work or answer his phone. They found Galfy dead in his bed, wearing only underwear and socks. Authorities say McGillivary beat Galfy, then left for Asbury Park and later headed to Philadelphia with a friend. On May 14, McGillivary, who is originally from Canada, wrote a post on his Facebook page intimating he was drugged and sexually assaulted, but did not say where or when. The post read: 'what would you do if you woke up with a groggy head, metallic taste in your mouth, in a strangers house ... and started wretching, realizing that someone had drugged (and) raped ... you? what would you do.' Then-Union County Prosecutor Theodore Romankow has called those comments 'self-serving'. Celebrity: McGillvary (left) became an Internet. sensation in February after giving an interview about his hatchet. heroics, and he was even invited by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (right) to appear on his show. McGillivary was arrested two days later in Philadelphia after a Starbucks staffer recognized his distinctive facial tattoo and called police. McGillivary became a minor internet celebrity in California last February when hitchhiking. After he was picked up, he used the handle of a hatchet to subdue the driver when that man tried to kill a utility worker with his car, which is how he earned his moniker. McGillivary attracted fans across the country, mostly through Facebook and Twitter, and did a few chat show interviews, including Jimmy Kimmel.

"Question: What is the last name of the person who asked the composer that  met Stravinsky and Gershwin whether ""...a clarinet player ever done you an injury?""?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: ""Drivel That They Paid to Hear"". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of ""relentless cacophony"". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as ""harmless"". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: ""The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention."" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, ""as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water"".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance. The players did...

"The Portuguese Restoration War  was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year Iberian Union. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch-Portuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War. The war established the House of Braganza as Portugal's new ruling dynasty, replacing the House of Habsburg. This ended the so-called Iberian Union.
